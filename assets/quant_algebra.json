					<br/><b>Basic Concepts of Algebra:</b>
					<br/>An algebraic expression is obtained by combining numbers and letters together with arithmetic operators.
					<br/><b>Algebraic Terms:</b>
					<br/>1.	If an expression contains only one term , then it is called monomial (3a)
					<br/>2.	If an expression contains 2 terms, then it is called a binomial (l + 2m)
					<br/>3.	If an expression contains 2 or more terms it is called polynomial. (l + 3m – 2n)
					<br/><b>Arithmetic Operations on Algebraic Expressions:</b>
					<br/><b>1.	Addition and subtraction:</b>
					<br/>To find the sum of a polynomial  add the numerical coefficients of like terms and annex the common letter or letters.
					<br/><b>2.	Multiplication:</b> To multiply one polynomial with another:
					<br/><b>(i)</b>	The product of 2 factors with like signs is positive, and of those with unlike signs is negative.
					<br/><b>(ii)</b>	Multiply each one term of one polynomial by each term of other. Add the like terms thus obtained.					
					<br/><b>Properties of Polynomials:</b>
					<br/><b>1.	Remainder theorem of Polynomials:</b>
					<br/>If a polynomial in one variable x is divided by x – a, where a is any real number, then the remainder is the value of the polynomial at x = a (See example 1)
					<br/><b>2.	Factorization of polynomials:</b>
					<br/>An expression is said to be resolved into factors when those expressions of which it is the product are found.
					<br/>Ex. x<sup>2</sup>- 5x+6 can be expressed as a product of (x – 2) and (x – 3)
					<br/><b>3.	HCF of polynomials:</b>
					<br/>When 2 or more polynomial are factorized, the product of all common factors is the HCF of the polynomials.
					<br/><b>4.	LCM of polynomials:</b>
					<br/>When 2 or more polynomials are factorized, the product of all the factors with the highest powers is the LCM of the polynomials.
					<br/>Ex. Find the HCF and LCM of 14xy<sup>3</sup>,  22x<sup>2</sup> y,  26x<sup>3</sup> y<sup>4</sup>
					<br/>14xy<sup>3</sup> = 2 X 7 X x X y<sup>3</sup>
					<br/>22x<sup>2</sup> y = 2 X 11 X x<sup>2</sup>  X y
					<br/>26x<sup>3</sup> y<sup>4</sup> = 2 X 13 X x<sup>3</sup> X y<sup>4</sup>
					<br/>HCF = 2 X x X y = 2xy
					<br/>LCM = 2 X 7 X 11 X 13 X x<sup>3</sup> X y<sup>4</sup> = 2002x<sup>3</sup> y<sup>4</sup>					
					<br/><b>Important algebraic Formulas:</b>
					<br/> 1.   (a+b)<sup>2</sup>=a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + 2ab
					<br/> 2.   (a-b)<sup>2</sup>=a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - 2ab
					<br/> 3.   (a+b)<sup>2</sup> + (a-b)<sup>2</sup> =〖2(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>)
					<br/> 4.   (a+b)<sup>2</sup> - (a-b)<sup>2</sup> = 4ab
					<br/> 5.   (a+b+c)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> + 2(ab+bc+ca)
					<br/> 6.   (a+b+c+d)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> + d<sup>2</sup> + 2a(b+c+d)+ 2b(c+d)+ 2cd
					<br/> 7.   (a+b)<sup>3</sup> = a<sup>3</sup> + b<sup>3</sup> + 3ab(a+b)
					<br/> 8.   (a-b)<sup>3</sup> = a<sup>3</sup> - b<sup>3</sup> - 3ab(a-b)
					<br/> 9.   a<sup>3</sup> + b<sup>3</sup> = (a+b)<sup>3</sup> -  3ab(a+b)=(a+b)(a<sup>2</sup>- ab + b<sup>2</sup>)
					<br/> 10.  a<sup>3</sup> - b<sup>3</sup> = (a-b)<sup>3</sup> +  3ab(a-b)=(a-b)(a<sup>2</sup> + ab + b<sup>3</sup>) 
					<br/> 11.  a<sup>3</sup> + b<sup>3</sup> + c<sup>3</sup> - 3abc=(a+b+c)(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> - ab-ac-bc)
					<br/> 12.  If  a+b+c = 0 then a<sup>3</sup> + b<sup>3</sup> + c<sup>3</sup> = 3abc
					<br/> 13.  (x+a)<sup>n</sup> = x<sup>n</sup> + nC1x<sup>(n-1)</sup>y + nC2x<sup>(n-2)</sup>y<sup>2</sup> + ..... + nCny<sup>n</sup>
					<br/> 14.  (x-a)<sup>n</sup> = x<sup>n</sup> - nC1x<sup>(n-1)</sup>y + nC2x<sup>(n-2)</sup>y<sup>2</sup> + ..... + (-1)<sup>n</sup> nCny<sup>n</sup>
					<br/>This is also known as Binomial theorem, In general Binomial theorem:
					<br/>(x+a)<sup>n</sup> = ∑(k=0)<sup>n</sup>(<sup>n</sup><sub>k</sub>) x<sup>k</sup> a<sup>(n-k)</sup>

					<br/><b>Linear Equation:</b>
					<br/>An equation is a statement in which two algebraic expressions are equal. If the equation is of first order (i.e. highest power of the variable is 1) than it is called a linear equation or a simple equation.
					<br/>It can be represented by ax + b = 0, where x is the variable and a and b are real numbers (a≠0)
					<br/><b>Practical use of 'Linear Equation while solving Questions':</b>
					<br/>1.	If a person has a certain amount of money only in 10 cents, 25 cents  and 50 cents coins. He has ‘x’ coins of 10 cents. The number of 25 cents coins is 2 less than the number of 10 cents coins. The number of 50 cents coins is 3 more than the number of 10 cents coins.
					<br/>   Total amount with the person (In Cents) = 10x + 25(x-2) + 50(x+3)
					<br/>2.	If David’s present age is ‘x’ years, then:
					<br/>   David’s age 5 years hence will be ‘x+5’ years	 	
					<br/>   David’s age 6 years ago was ‘x-6’ years
					<br/>   David’s father’s present age, which is twice that of David’s age is ‘2x’ years.
					<br/>3.	If 3 digit number ‘xyz’ where x is hundred’s digit, y is the ten’s digit and z is the unit’s digit, 
					<br/>   So the number can be expressed as ‘100x + 10y +z’
					<br/>   The number formed by reversing the digit is 100z + 10y + x
					<br/>4.	Consider 3 consecutive natural numbers. If ‘x’ is taken as the lowest number, then 3 consecutive natural numbers (including x) are ‘x’, ‘x+1’ and ‘x+2’. 
					<br/>5.	Consecutive 3 consecutive odd numbers. If ‘x’ is taken as the lowest odd number, then 3 consecutive odd numbers (including x) are ‘x’, ‘x+2’ and ‘x+4’. Similarly, 3 consecutive even numbers can also be expressed as ‘x’, ‘x+2’ and ‘x+4’, If ‘x’ is taken as lowest even number.

					<b><br/>Simultaneous Equation:</b>
					<br/>A set of 2 or more linear equations in 2 or more variables, which are satisfied simultaneously by the unique solution, are called simultaneous equation.
					<br/>For ex. x + y = 7 and x – y = 3 are only satisfied by the pair, x = 5 and y = 2 only.
					<b><br/>Methods of solving simultaneous equations:</b>
					<b><br/>1.	By Elimination Method:</b>
					<br/>To solve simultaneous equations, it is necessary to eliminate one of the two variables and obtain an equation, which has only one variable. For this, the coefficient of the variable to be eliminated is first made equal in both the equations and then the two equations are either added or subtracted.
					<br/>Ex. Solve 
					<br/>x + y = 12 ..….  (i)
					<br/>x – y = 4   ……  (ii)
					<br/>The variable y has different signs, but same coefficient so by adding both equations 
					<br/>2x = 16 or x = 8;
					<br/>Now, substitute this value of ‘x’ in any of the equation.
					<br/>(Substituting the value of ‘x’ in equation (i)), 8 + y = 12 or y = 4
					<br/>So solution set is (8,4)
					<b><br/>NOTE:</b> 
					<br/>When coefficient of both the variable is different in the 2 equations, multiply or divide these equations with real numbers other than 0 to obtain new equations equivalent to the original ones in such a way that one of variable can be easily eliminated.
					<b><br/>2.	By Substitution Method:</b> 
					<br/>Ex. Solve
					<br/>5x + 2y = 24 ……… (i)
					<br/>4x –3 y = 10     ……... (II)
					<br/>If we multiply first equation by 3 and second equation by 2, coefficient of y in equation (i) will become 6 and in equation (ii) -6. Thus  y can easily be eliminated by adding both equations.
					<br/>These equations can also be solved by expressing one of the variables in an equation in terms of the other and then substituting this value of the variable in second equation.
					<br/>Ex.  Solve 
					<br/>5x + 2y = 24 ……… (i)
					<br/>4x –3 y = 10     ……... (II)
					<br/>From (ii), y = 3x – 10
					<br/>Substituting this value of ‘y’ in equation (i),
					<br/>5x + 2(3x – 10) = 24
					<br/>5x – 20 + 6x = 24
					<br/>11x = 44 or x = 4;

					<b><br/>Quadratic  Equation:</b>
					<br/>A polynomial of degree 2 is called quadratic polynomial. An equation p(x) = 0, where p(x) is a quadratic polynomial, is called a quadratic equation. The general form of a quadratic polynomial is ax<sup>2</sup>+ bx+c; where a,b and c are real numbers, a ≠ 0 and x is a variable.
					<b><br/>Roots of quadratic equation:</b>
					<b><br/>1.	By method of factorization by splitting the middle term:</b>
					<br/>Consider the equation ax^2+ bx+c = 0 and factorize the term ‘ac’ such that the sum of two factors is equal to b.
					<br/>Example:
					<br/>x<sup>2</sup> + 2x - 63 = 0 
					<br/>Here a = 1, b = 2 and c= -63; ac = -63
					<br/>The factors of -63  whose sum is equal to 2 is 9 and -7;
					<br/>Thus 2x can be replaced by 9x – 7x
					<br/> x<sup>2</sup> + 9x - 7x - 63=0 
					<br/>x(x +9) – 7 (x + 9) = 0
					<br/>(x+9)(x-7) = 0
					<br/>So the roots of this equation are x = -9 ; x = 7
					<b><br/>2.	By using formula:</b>
					<br/>For equation (ax)<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 ;
					<br/>Roots of two equation is given by x = (-b±√(b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac))/2a
					<br/>Example
					<br/>x<sup>2</sup>-5x+6=0 
					<br/>a = 1, b =-5, c =6;
					<br/>x = (-b±√(b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac))/2a  = (-(-5)±√((-5)<sup>2</sup> - 4X1X6))/2X1
					<br/> =  (5±√(25-24))/2X1 = (5±1)/2 
					<br/>So x = (6/2) = 3 or (4/2) = 2	
					<b><br/>Relation between roots and coefficient:</b>
					<br/>1.  In equation ax<sup>2</sup> + bx+c = 0, if we divide both sides of the equation by ‘a’, (a≠0) then we get the equation as: 
					<br/>x<sup>2</sup> + b/a x+ c/a   = 0 ...............(i)
					<br/>Now if we consider two roots of the equation as α and β, then:
					<br/>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = (x – α) (x – β) = 0
					<br/>= x<sup>2</sup> - (α + β)x + (αβ) = 0  ............(ii)
					<br/>By comparing equation (i) and (ii)
					<br/>(α + β) = - b/a = -  (coefficient of x)/(Coefficient of x<sup>2</sup> )
					<br/>αβ =  c/a = -  (constant term)/(Coefficient of x<sup>2</sup> ) (see example 2)
					<br/>2. Signs of the roots a quadratic equation depending upon the sign of a, b and c
					<br/>    <b>Signs of roots		||		Signs of a, b and c</b>
					<br/>I	 Both roots are negative ||	a,b,c all have same sign
					<br/>II	 One root positive and other negative  ||  a and c have different signs
					<br/>III Both roots are positive  ||  a and c have the same sign and differ in sign from b
					<br/>3. If c = a, the roots are reciprocals of each other.
					<br/>4. If b = 0, the roots are equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign.
					<br/>5. If one root of equation with real coefficient is a complex number the other root must be its conjugate complex number. If α = m + in, then β = m – in
					<br/>6. If one root of equation with rational coefficient be irrational,  other root must be its irrational conjugate. If α = m + √n, then β = m – √n,
					<br/>7. If we know roots (α and β) of any equation then, equation can be formed as:
					<br/>    x<sup>2</sup> - (α + β) + αβ = 0
					<br/>8. Nature of roots depends upon the expression  b<sup>2</sup>- 4ac, and denoted as ∆
					<br/><b>Nature of Roots	 ||  Condition</b>
					<br/>Complex conjugate numbers	|| ∆ <  0
					<br/>Real Numbers	|| ∆≥0  
					<br/>Real and Equal	|| ∆ = 0
					<br/>Real and Unequal 	|| ∆ > 0
					<br/>Rational and Unequal	|| ∆ > 0 ∆ is a perfect square
					<br/>Irrational and Unequal	|| ∆ > 0 ∆ is not a perfect square
					<br/><b>Graphical represent of Quadratic Equation</b>
					<br/>If we draw the graph of y = ax<sup>2</sup>+ bx+c in the xy plane, it is the form of a parabola.
					<br/>By solving y = x<sup>2</sup> – 8x + 15 
					<br/>By putting different values of x, we will get different values of x
					<br/>x	1	2	3	4	5	6
					<br/>y	8	3	0	-1	0	3
					<br/>Which could be represented as : Here draw graph
					<br/>The shape of the parabola in a quadratic equation depends on the value of the numerical coefficient of the variables in equation.
					<br/>	1. If a > 0, then parabola opens upwards and if a< 0, then parabola opens downwards.
					<br/>	2. If b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac < 0, then the parabola does not intercept the x – axis.
					<br/>	3. If b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac > 0, then the parabola intercepts the x axis at exactly two different points.
					<br/>	4. If b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac = 0, then the parabola intercepts the x axis at exactly one point

					<b><br/>Inequalities:</b>
					<br/>A mathematical statement, which states that two expression are not equal is called an inequation and denoted by x  ≠ y.
					<b><br/>Rules of Inequalities:</b>
					<br/>•	An inequality will still hold after each side has been increased, diminished, multiplied or divided by the same number i.e. a > b and c is any number
					<br/>   ac > bc
					<br/>   a – c > b – c 
					<br/>•	If the sides of an inequality are multiplied or divided by the same negative quantity, the sign of in inequality reversed.  i.e., if a > b and c < 0, then ac < bc
					<br/>•	In an inequality, any term may be transposed from one side to the other if its sign is changed. i.e. if a –c  > b, then a > b + c or  -c > b - a
					<b><br/>Absolute Value and Inequalities:</b>
					<br/>•	|x| is always positive
					<br/>•	|x| ≥ x
					<br/>•	|x-y| = |y-x|
					<br/>•	|x+y| ≤ |x| + |y|
					<br/>•	|x+y| ≥ |x| - |y|
					<br/>•	|x-y|  ≥  |x| - |y|
					<br/>•	|x|≤ a  → -a ≤ x ≤ a
					<br/>•	|x| ≥ a → x ≥ a or x ≤ -a
					<b><br/>Solving Inequalities:</b>
					<br/>1. Linear inequalities: 
					<br/>To solve an inequality in one variable, transpose all the terms containing variable to left hand side of inequality and the remaining to the right hand side.
					<br/>Ex. 2x + 3 < 5x +6
					<br/>2x – 5x < 6 – 3
					<br/>i.e. – 3x < 3
					<br/>or x > 1
					<br/>In case of solving inequality with Modules (||), use absolute value rules as mentioned above.
					<br/>|5x +3| < 4 as |x|≤ a  → -a ≤ x ≤ a
					<br/>-4 < 5x +3 < 4
					<br/>Or -4 < 5x +3 and 5x +3 > 4 or x > (-7/5) and x < (1/5);
					<br/>So  -(7/5) < x < (1/5)
					<br/>2. Quadratic Inequalities
					<br/>	Case 1: when ax^2+ bx+c  > 0
					<br/>Or (x-α) (x-β) > 0 ; where α < β
					<br/>So x < α or x > β
					<br/>	Case 2:  when ax^2+ bx+c  < 0
					<br/>Or (x-α) (x-β) < 0 
					<br/> So α < x < β; i.e. x lies between α and β
					<b><br/>Application of Rules of Inequalities:</b>
					<br/>If a ,b,c…….k are n unequal quantities, then, (a+b+c…….+k)<sup>n</sup>/n > a X b X c  …..X k
					<br/>i.e. [a+b+c……+k]/n  >  [(a X b X c  …..X k)<sup>(1/n)</sup>]/n
					<br/>Arithmetic Mean of any positive number is greater than their geometric mean.
					<br/>(n!)<sup>2</sup> > n<sup>n</sup>, for n>2
					<br/>a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> ≥ bc + ca + ab
					<br/>a<sup>2</sup>b + b<sup>2</sup>c + c<sup>2</sup>b ≥ 3abc
					<br/>a/b + b/c +c/d +d/a ≥ 4
					<br/>a<sup>4</sup> + b<sup>4</sup> + c<sup>4</sup> + d<sup>4</sup> ≥ 4abcd
					<br/>If a, b, c are positive and not all equal, then (a + b + c)(ab +bc + ca) >9abc
					<br/>If a, b, c are positive and not all equal, then, (b+c)(c+a)(a+b) > 8abc

					 <br/>We have to find out the values of 'x' that will satisfy the four inequalities given in the answer choices and check out the choice in which the range of values satisfying is finite.
					<br/>Choice A
					<br/>Factorizing the given equation, we get (x + 2)(x + 3) > 0.
					<br/>This inequality will hold good when both x + 2 and x + 3 are simultaneously positive or simultaneously negative.
					<br/>Evaluating both the options, we get the range of values of 'x' that satisfy this inequality to be x < -2 or x > -3. i.e., 'x' does not lie between -2 and -3 or an infinite range of values.
					<br/>Choice B

					<br/>Option 1: x + 2 > 4 or
