					<br/>The basic approach for these questions is more or less to 'Coding & Decoding'. As in 'Coding & Decoding', a basic word is coded in a particular way and the candidate is asked to code another word using the same logic.
					<br/>Similarly in 'Symbol and Notations', one has to study the symbols and their meanings carefully which are given against them. Then, the meanings given are to be used in place of those symbols in answering the questions. The word 'Notation' basically stands for the meaning which each symbol will be assigned.				
					<br/>Symbols for these types of questions stand for mathematical operations i.e. +, -, X, ÷, <,>,≤ ,≥ ,=and ≠. So one must replace the symbols be mathematical operations and apply the ‘BODMAS’ rule to find the value of given expression. Symbols like ∆,∇,*,@,$,∂ etc are used by giving a proper definition of the symbol used.

					<b>Find 467 is prime or not?</b>
					<br/>Ans. We find by trial that 467 is not divisible by any of primes 2,5,7,â€¦â€¦.19,23. But on dividing by 23 we get a quotient less then 23, and we need not go further. For, if 467 contained a prime factor beyond 23, the quotient obtained on dividing 467 by that prime factor would be less than 23, and must have been revealed as a factor by the former trials. Hence, 467 has no prime factor greater or less than 23; that is, it is prime number. In general, to find whether a number is prime or not, we need to check whether it is divisible by any of the primes up to the square root of that number.

					 <br/>132 = 4 x 3 x 11
