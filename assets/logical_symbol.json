					<br/>The basic approach for these questions is more or less to 'Coding & Decoding'. As in 'Coding & Decoding', a basic word is coded in a particular way and the candidate is asked to code another word using the same logic.
					<br/>Similarly in 'Symbol and Notations', one has to study the symbols and their meanings carefully which are given against them. Then, the meanings given are to be used in place of those symbols in answering the questions. The word 'Notation' basically stands for the meaning which each symbol will be assigned.				
					<br/>Symbols for these types of questions stand for mathematical operations i.e. +, -, X, ÷, <,>,≤ ,≥ ,=and ≠. So one must replace the symbols be mathematical operations and apply the ‘BODMAS’ rule to find the value of given expression. Symbols like ∆,∇,*,@,$,∂ etc are used by giving a proper definition of the symbol used.
