					<br/>Seating arrangement refers to the sitting pattern of any object or person. There are two types of sitting arrangements
					<br/><b>1.	Linear Arrangements:-</b> 
					<br/>In these arrangements objects/person are arranged only on the 'axis' and hence, the position of the subjects assumes importance here in terms of order like first position, second position etc.
					<br/><b>2.	Circular Arrangements:-</b>
					<br/>Questions on circular arrangement involve seating of people around a table or arrangement of things in a circular manner. (For example, different coloured beads strung to form a necklace)
					<br/><b>Important Points:-</b> 
					<br/>1.	In case of people sitting around a table, the table could be of any shape – rectangular, square, circular or any other type.
					<br/>2.	The data given in such sets of questions specify the positions of some or all of the individuals (or things) in the arrangement. The positions are specified through conditions involving specified persons sitting (or not sitting) opposite each other or a particular person sitting to the right or left of another person, etc.
					<br/>3.	Once you read the data, first draw the shape specified in the data and then draw the slots in the seating arrangement.
					<br/>4.	Statements like 'A and B are sitting farthest from each other' or 'A and B sit across the table' imply that A and B sit opposite each other.
					<br/>5.	Unlike Linear arrangement words like 'immediately' and 'directly' do not play role in circular arrangement. So, if its given that C sits to right of B, then it is clear that C must be to the immediate right of B. 
					<br/>6.	Go 'anti-clockwise' if anybody’s right has to be located, and go 'clockwise' if somebody’s left has to be located.

					<b>Find 467 is prime or not?</b>
					<br/>Ans. We find by trial that 467 is not divisible by any of primes 2,5,7,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦.19,23. But on dividing by 23 we get a quotient less then 23, and we need not go further. For, if 467 contained a prime factor beyond 23, the quotient obtained on dividing 467 by that prime factor would be less than 23, and must have been revealed as a factor by the former trials. Hence, 467 has no prime factor greater or less than 23; that is, it is prime number. In general, to find whether a number is prime or not, we need to check whether it is divisible by any of the primes up to the square root of that number.

					 <br/>132 = 4 x 3 x 11
					<br/>So, if the number divisible by all the three number 4, 3 and 11, then the number is divisible by 132 also.
