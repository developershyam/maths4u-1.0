					<br/>The hour hand and the minute hand of a clock move in relation to each other continuously and at any given point of time, they make an angle between 0° and 180° with each other.
					<br/>If the time shown by the clock is known, the angle between the hands can be calculated. Similarly, if the angle between 2 hands is known, the time shown by the clock can be found out.When we say angle between the hands, we normally refer to the acute/obtuse angles (upto 180°) between the 2 hands and not the reflex angle (<180°)
					<br/><b>Important Points:-</b>
					<br/>1. Minute hand covers 360° in 1 hour, i.e., in 60 minutes. Hence Minute hand covers 6° per minute.
					<br/>2. Hour hand covers 360° in 12 hours. Hence, hour hand covers 30° per hour. Hence, Hour Hand cover ½ ° per minute.
					<br/>3. In a period of 12 hours
					<br/>* The hands make an angle of 0° with each other (i.e. they coincide with each other), 11 times.
					<br/>* The hands make an angel of 180°  (i.e. they lie on the same straight line), 11 times.
					<br/>* 90° or any other angle with each other, 22 times.
					<br/>4. The time gap between any 2 coincidences is 12/11 hours or 655/11 minutes.
					<br/>5. If the hands of a clock (which do not show the correct time)coincide every p minute, then 
					<br/>   * If p > 655/11, then the watch is going slow or losing time.
					<br/>   * If p < 655/11, then the watch is going fast or gaining time.
					<br/>6. To calculate the angle 'θ’ between the hands of a clock, we use the following formula is used (where m = minutes and h = hours)
							<br/>* θ= 11/2 m-30h (when  11/2 m>30h)
							<br/>* θ= 30h- 11/2 m (when  11/2 m<30h)
					<br/>7. 'Clock' problems can also be solved with 'Relative Velocity' method. As in 1 minute, minute hand covers 6° and hour hand covers ½ °. Therefore, Relative velocity = 6 – ½ = 5½° per minute. Alternatively, in 1 hour, the minute hand covers 60 minute divisions whereas the hour hand covers 5 minute divisions. So relative speed = 60 – 5 = 55 minutes. However, adopting the approach of actual angles covered is by far the simplest and does not create any confusion.
