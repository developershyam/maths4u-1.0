					<br/>Suppose you are asked to find the day of the week on 30th June, 1974. It would be tough job for you if you don’t know the method. The method of finding the day of the week lies in the number of 'odd days'.
					<br/><b>Note:-</b> Every 7th day will be the same day count wise, i.e. if today is Monday, then 7th day will again be Monday. Odd day is the days remaining after completion of an exact number of weeks. Odd days is the reminder obtained on dividing the total number of days with seven.
					<br/>Ex. 52 days + 7 =  3 odd days.
					<br/><b>Leap Year:-</b>
					<br/>(i). Every year divisible by 4 is a leap year, if it is not a century.
					<br/>(ii). Every 4th century is a leap year and no other century is a leap year.
					<br/><b>Note:-</b> A leap year has 366 days.
					<br/><b>Examples:-</b>
					<br/>i.	Each of the years 1948, 2004, 1676 etc. is a leap year.
					<br/>ii.	Each of the years 400, 800, 1200, 1600, 2000 etc. is a leap year.
					<br/>iii.	None of the years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 1800, 2100 is a leap year.
					<br/><b>Ordinary Year:-</b>
					The year which is not a leap year is called an ordinary years. An ordinary year has 365 days.
					<br/><b>1.	Counting of Odd Days:-</b>
					<br/> 1.	1 ordinary year = 365 days = (52 weeks + 1 day.)
					<br/>       1 ordinary year has 1 odd day.
					<br/> 2.	1 leap year = 366 days = (52 weeks + 2 days)
					<br/>       1 leap year has 2 odd days.
					<br/> 3.	100 years = 76 ordinary years + 24 leap years
					<br/>       = (76 x 1 + 24 x 2) odd days = 124 odd days.
					<br/>       = (17 weeks + days)   5 odd days.
					<br/>       Number of odd days in 100 years = 5.
					<br/>       Number of odd days in 200 years = (5 x 2)   3 odd days.
					<br/>       Number of odd days in 300 years = (5 x 3)   1 odd day.
					<br/>       Number of odd days in 400 years = (5 x 4 + 1)   0 odd day.
					<br/>       Similarly, each one of 800 years, 1200 years, 1600 years, 2000 years etc. has 0 odd days.
					<br/><b>Counting of Odd days, when only 1 date is given:-</b>
					<br/>Here we take January 1st AD as the earlier date and we assume that this days is Monday. We take its previous day, i.e. Sunday as the reference day. After this the above mentioned method is applied to count the number of odd days and find the day of the week for the given date.
					<br/><b>Counting number of odd days, when 2 dates are given:-</b> 					
					<br/>Any month which has 31 days has 3 odd days and any month which has 30 days has 2 odd days. Then, the total number of odd days are calculated by adding the odd days for each month. The value so obtained is again divided by 7 to get the final number of odd days. The day of the week of the second date is obtained by adding the odd days to the day of the week of the earlier date.
