					<br/>Polygons are many-sided figures, with sides that are line segments. Polygons are named according to the number of sides and angles they have.
					<br/><b>Properties of Polygon:</b>
					<br/>A polygon with equal sides is called 'Regular Polygon'.
					<br/>The segment joining any two non-consecutive vertices is called a diagonal.
					<br/>Number of diagonals of a polygon with n sides = (n (n-3))/2
					<br/>For ex. In a Octagon number of diagonals will be (8 (8-3))/2 = 20
					<br/>Sum of all interior angles of a n-gon (polygon of n sides n) is given by (n-2)180Â°
					<br/>Hence, each interior angle of a regular n-gon = ( (n-2)180Â°)/n
					<br/>Sum of an interior angle and its adjacent exterior angle is 180Â°.
					<br/>Sum of all exterior angles of polygon is 360Â°
					<br/>For a regular polygon, each exterior angle =(360Â°)/n
					<br/>In a regular Pentagon each interior angle is 108Â° and each exterior angle is 72Â°.
					<br/>In a regular Pentagon each interior angle is 120Â° and each exterior angle is 60Â°.
					<br/><b>Quadrilaterals:</b>
					<br/>A polygon of four sides is called quadrilateral. The sum of measures of all angles of a quadrilateral is 360Â°.
					<br/><b>Types of Quadrilaterals:</b>
				   <br/><b>1.	Parallelogram:</b> A quadrilateral is called parallelogram, if its opposite sides are parallel.
				   <br/>  •  Opposite sides are parallel and congruent.				  
				   <br/>  •  Opposite angles are congruent.
				   <br/>  •  Diagonals bisect each other.
				   <br/>  •  Sum of any two adjacent angles is 180Â°.
				   <br/>  •  Each diagonal divides the parallelogram into 2 triangles of equal area.
				   <br/>  •  Straight lines joining the midpoints of the adjacent sides of any quadrilateral from a parallelogram.
				   <br/>  •  Sum of the squares of the diagonals is equal to the sum of squares of the 4 sides of a parallelogram.
				   <br/>     AC<sup>2</sup>+ BD<sup>2</sup>  = AB<sup>2</sup>+ BC<sup>2</sup>+ CD<sup>2</sup>+ AD<sup>2</sup>=2(AB<sup>2</sup>+ AC<sup>2</sup>)	
				   <br/>  •  Parallelograms that lie on the same base and between the same parallel lines are equal in area.
				   <br/>  •  If  a triangle and parallelogram lie on the same base and between the same parallel lines,  Area (triangle) = 1/2 Area (Parallelogram)
				   <br/>  •  If midpoints of the adjacent sides of a parallelogram are joined, a parallelogram is formed.
				   <br/><b>2.	Rectangle:</b> A parallelogram, in which each angle is a right angle is called rectangle. 
				   <br/>  •  Opposite sides are parallel and congruent.
				   <br/>  •  Each angle is equal to 90Â°
				   <br/>  •  Diagonal are congruent and bisect each other.
				   <br/>  •  If midpoints of the adjacent sides of a rectangle are joined, a rhombus is formed.
				   <br/><b>3.	Rhombus:</b> A parallelogram in which all sides are congruent is called Rhombus.
				   <br/>  •	 Opposite sides are parallel.
				   <br/>  •	 All sides are congruent.
				   <br/>  •	 Opposite angles are congruent.
				   <br/>  •	 Diagonals bisect at right angles side<sup>2</sup>=(1/2  one diagonal)<sup>2</sup>+ (1/2  other diagonal)<sup>2</sup>  
				   <br/>  •	 A parallelogram is a rhombus if its diagonals are perpendicular to each other.
				   <br/>  •	 If midpoints of the adjacent sides of a rhombus are joined, a rectangle is formed.
				   <br/><b>4.	Square:</b> A rectangle in which all sides are congruent is called a squire.
				   <br/>  •	 All sides are congruent and opposite sides are parallel.
				   <br/>  •	 All angles are 90Â°.
				   <br/>  •	 The diagonals are congruent and bisect each other at right angles.
				   <br/>  •	 Diagonal = âˆš2 X side
				   <br/>  •	 A parallelogram is a square if its diagonals are congruent and bisect each other at right angles.
				   <br/>  •	 If midpoints of the adjacent sides of a square are joined, a square is formed.
				   <br/><b>5.	Trapezium:</b> A quadrilateral is called a trapezium, if two of the opposite sides are parallel but the other sides are not.
				   <br/>  •	 The segment joining the midpoints of the oblique (non parallel) sides is called median of the trapezium.
                   <br/>  •	 Median = 1/2 X sum of parallel sides
				   <br/><b>6.	Kite:</b> A quadrilateral is called a kite, if it has two pairs of equal and adjacent sides.
                   <br/>  •	 Two pairs of adjacent sides are congruent.
                   <br/>  •	 The diagonals intersect at right angles.
                   <br/>  •	 The longer diagonal bisects the shorter one.

					<br/>Co-ordinate Geometry is that branch of geometry in which 2 numbers i.e. the co-ordinates are used to indicate the position of a point in the plane.
					<br/>The horizontal line is called the 'X axis' and the vertical line is called 'Y axis'. Their point of interaction is called the 'Origin'. The x and y axis divide the plane into 4 quadrants referred as first, second, third and fourth quadrant.
					<br/>If P be a point in fourth quadrant, its distance from X and Y axis is called rectangular Cartesian or 'Co-ordinates of P'. The x and y co-ordinates of a point in the quadrant are:
					<br/>--------diagram-------
					<br/><b>Important Points:-</b>
					<br/><b>1.	Distance formula:</b>
					<br/>The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) = √[(x1-x2)<sup>2</sup> + (y1-y2)<sup>2</sup> ]
					<br/><b>2.	Section Formula:</b>
					<br/><b>    Internal Division:</b>
					<br/>If P is a point dividing the joint of two points A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2) internally in the ratio m: n then co-ordinates (x, y) of P is given by:
					<br/>P(x,y) = [(mx<sub>2</sub> + nx<sub>1</sub>)/(m+n), (my<sub>2</sub> + ny<sub>1</sub>)/(m+n)]
					<br/><b>    External Division:</b>
					<br/>If P is a point dividing the joint of two points A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2) externally in the ratio m: n then co-ordinates (x, y) of P is given by:
					<br/><br/>P(x,y) = [(mx<sub>2</sub> - nx<sub>1</sub>)/(m-n), (my<sub>2</sub> - ny<sub>1</sub>)/(m-n)]
					<br/><b>    Midpoint:</b>
					<br/>: If P is the midpoint of segment then: 
					<br/><br/>P(x,y) = [(x<sub>2</sub> + x<sub>1</sub>)/2, (y<sub>2</sub> + y<sub>1</sub>)/2]
					<br/><b>3.	Centroid of a Triangle:</b>
					<br/>	Centroid is the point of intersection of 3 medians of triangle
					<br/>If A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2) and C(x3, y3) are the vertices of a triangle, then The co-ordinates of the centroid G(x,y) of the the ∆ ABC are:
					<br/><br/>P(x,y) = [(x<sub>1</sub> + x<sub>2</sub> + x<sub>3</sub>)/3, (y<sub>1</sub> + y<sub>2</sub> + y<sub>3</sub>)/3]				    
				    <br/><b>4.	Incentre of a Triangle</b>
				    <br/>Incentre is the point of intersection of three angle bisector of triangle.
				    <br/>-----diagram-------
				    <br/>The co-ordinates of the incentre (x, y) of the ∆ ABC with vertices A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2) and C(x3, y3) are 
				    <br/>I(x, y)  = [(ax1+bx2+cx3)/(a+b+c), (ay1+by2+cy3)/(a+b+c)]
				    <br/><b>5.	Area of Triangle:</b>
				    <br/>If A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2) and C(x3, y3) are 3 vertices of triangle then:
				    <br/>Area of triangle = 1/2[x1(y2 – y3) – x2(y1 – y3) – x3(y1 – y3)]
					<br/>If the area = 0, then 3 points are collinear.
				    <br/><b>Equation of a line</b>
				    <br/>A geometrical condition satisfied by all points P(x,y) on a straight line when expressed in x or y is called equation of a straight line.
				    <br/><b>Inclination of a line</b>
				    <br/>If a straight line intersects the x-axis, the inclination of the line is defined as the measure of the angle. The slope of a line is the ratio of rate of change of y to rate of change of x. It is defined by ‘m’. Slope of a line joining 2 points A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2)
					<br/>m = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) = tan⁡θ
				    <br/>Two lines whose slopes m1 and m2 are parallel to each other than m1 = m2;
					<br/>Two lines whose slopes are m1 and m2 are parallel to each other, if and only if m1 X m2 = -1
					<br/>Thus, if the slope of a line is m, the slope of a line perpendicular to it is - 1/m
				    
				    <br/><b>Important Points</b>
				    <br/>•	The equation of a line parallel to x axis and at a distance of k units is y = k.
					<br/>•	Equation of x axis is y = 0
					<br/>•	The equation of a line parallel to y axis at a distance of k units below it is  y = -k
					<br/>•	Equation of y axis is x = 0 
					<br/>•	The equation of a straight line passing through the point (x1, y1) and having slope m is  y – y1 = m(x – x1)
					<br/>•	The equation of a straight line passing through the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is (y-y1)/(x-x1)=  (y1-y2)/(x1-x2)  , where x1 ≠ x2
					<br/>•	The equation of a line having slope m and making an intercept c on y – axis is  y = mx + c
					<br/>•	The equation of a line making intercepts a and b, when a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0  x/a+  y/b=1
				    <br/>•	If the perpendicular drawn from the origin to a line has inclination α and length p, then the equation of the line is xcos⁡α+  ysin⁡α=p
					<br/>•	The equation of a line passing through a point (x	1, y1) and making an angle of θ with x axis is (x-x1)/cos⁡θ =  (y-y1)/sin⁡θ 
				    <br/>•	The most general form of an equation is of the form Ax + By + C = 0, always represent a line Slope m  = -A/B=  (- Cofficient of x)/(Coefficient of y)
				    <br/>		x intercept  = -C/A= -  ( Constant term)/(Coefficient of x), y intercept  = -C/B= -  ( Constant term)/(Coefficient of y)
				    <br/>•	If m1 and m2 are the slopes of 2 lines such that m1 X m2 ≠ 1, then tanθ=  (m1-m2)/(1 +m1m2) 
				    <br/><b>Perpendicular Distance</b>
				    <br/>•	The perpendicular distance of origin from a line Ax + By + C = 0, is given by C/√(A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup> )
					<br/>•	If P(x1 , y1) is any point and Ax + By + C = 0 is a line, then the perpendicular distance of p from line is (Ax1+By1+ C) / √(A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup>)
				    <br/>•	Distance between 2 parallel lines Ax + By + C1 = 0 and Ax + By + C2 = 0 is ( C1-C2) / √(A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup>)
				    <br/><b>Equation of Circle and Ellipse</b>
				    <br/><b>•	Equation of a circle</b>
				    <br/>If P(x, y) be any point on the circle whose center is C(h, k) and  radius is r. The equation of circle is given by √((x-h)<sup>2</sup> + (y-k)<sup>2</sup> ) = r.
				    <br/>When center is origin then equation is √(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> )=r
					<br/>The general form a circle with center as origin is x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.
				    <br/><b>•	Equation of a Ellipse</b>
				    <br/>An ellipse is the locus of a point, which moves such that the ratio ‘e’ of its distance from a fixed point and a fixed straight line is a constant and e≤1
					<br/>The equation of an ellipse in the standard form is x<sup>2</sup> / a<sup>2</sup> +  y<sup>2</sup>  /b<sup>2</sup>  = 1, where a and b are the lengths of the major and minor axis of ellipse.

					<br/>The plane figure bounded by the union of 3 lines, which join 3 non – collinear points, is called a triangle. It is denoted by symbol ∆.
					<br/><b>Properties of Triangle:</b>
					<br/>---diagram-----
					<br/>The sum of interior angles of a triangle is 180°.
					<br/>The sum of an interior angle and the adjacent exterior angle is 180°.
					<br/>Two exterior angles having same vertex are congruent.
					<br/>The sum of lengths of any 2 sides of a triangle is always greater than the third side. In ∆ABC a + b > c ; b + c > a ; a + c > b
					<br/>The difference of any 2 sides is always less than the 3rd side.
				    <br/>In ∆ ABC a – b < c; b – c < a; a – c < b
				    <br/>A triangle will have at least 2 acute angles
					<br/><b>Types of Triangles:	</b>			
					<br/>With regard to their sides, triangles are of 3 types
					<br/>------diagram--
					<br/>With regard to angles, triangles are of three types:
					<br/>------diagram--
					<br/><b>Similarity of Triangles:</b>
					<br/>When Are Triangles Similar?
					<br/>Two triangles are similar if any one of the following three possible scenarios is met:
					<br/>1.	AAA [Angle Angle Angle] - The corresponding angles of each triangle have the same measurement. In other words, the above triangles are similar if: Angle L = Angle O; Angle N = Angle Q; Angle M = Angle P
					<br/>2.	SAS [Side Angle Side] - An angle in one triangle is the same measurement as an angle in the other triangle and the two sides containing these angles have the same ratio. In other words, the above triangles are similar if: Angle L = Angle O; Side LM/Side OP = Side LN/Side OQ
					<br/><b>Note:</b> Any other combination of side, angle, side also proves similarity.
					<br/>3.	SSS [Side Side Side] - Each pair of corresponding sides have the same ratio. In other words, the above triangles are similar if: Side LM/Side OP = Side LN/Side OQ = Side MN/Side PQ 			
					<br/><b>Properties of Similar Triangles:</b>
					<br/>1.	Corresponding angles are the same measurement.
					<br/>2.	The perimeter of each triangle is in the same ratio as the sides.
					<br/>3.	Corresponding sides are all in the same proportion.
					<br/>4.	The triangles on each side of the altitude drawn from the vertex of the right angle to the hypotenuse are similar to the original triangle and to each other.
					<br/><b>Congruency of Triangles:</b>
					<br/>When Are Triangles Congruent?
					<br/>Two triangles are congruent if any one of the following three possible scenarios is met:
					<br/>1.	SAS [Side Angle Side] - Two pairs of corresponding sides are equal and the corresponding angle between the sides is equal. In other words, the above triangles are congruent if: Side SW = Side UV; Angle W = Angle V; Side WR = Side VT
					<br/><b>Note:</b> Any other combination of side, angle, side also proves congruence.
					<br/>2.	ASA [Angle Side Angle] - Two pairs of corresponding angles are equal and the corresponding side between them is equal. In other words, the above triangles are congruent if: Angle R = Angle T; Side RW = Side TV; Angle W = Angle V
					<br/><b>Note:</b> Any other combination of angle, side, angle also proves congruence.
					<br/>3.	SSS [Side Side Side] - All three pairs of corresponding sides are equal. In other words, the above triangles are congruent if: Side RS = Side TU; = Side RW = Side TV; Side SW = Side UV
					<br/><b>Properties of Congruent Triangles:</b>
					<br/>1.	Corresponding angles have the same measurement.
					<br/>2.	Corresponding sides have the same measurement.
					<br/><b>Triangle Based Theorems:</b>
					<br/><b>•	Pythagoras Theorem: </b>
					<br/>In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other 2 sides.
					<br/>AC<sup>2</sup> = AB<sup>2</sup> + BC<sup>2</sup>
					<br/>-------diagram --------
					<br/>In an 'Obtuse angle triangle', AB<sup>2</sup> + BC<sup>2</sup> < AC<sup>2</sup>
					<br/>In an 'Acute angle triangle', AB<sup>2</sup> + BC<sup>2</sup> < AC<sup>2</sup>
					<br/><b>•	Midpoint Theorem:</b>
					<br/>The segment joining the midpoints of any 2 sides of triangle is parallel to the third side and is half of the third side.
					<br/>-------diagram --------
					<br/>If AD = DB, AE = EC, then DE is parallel to BC and DE = 1/2BC
					<br/><b>•	Basic Proportionality Theorem:</b>
					<br/>If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle and intersects other sides in 2 distinct points, then the other sides are divided in the same ratio by it.
					<br/>-------diagram --------
					<br/>If DE is parallel to BC, then AD/DB=  AE/EC
					<br/><b>•	Interior Angle Bisector Theorem:</b>
					<br/>The angle bisector of any angle of a triangle divides the side opposite to the angle in the ratio of the remaining two sides.
					<br/>-------diagram --------
					<br/>In ∆ ABC, if AD is the angle bisector of ∠ BAC, then, AB/AC=  BC/CD
					<br/><b>•	Exterior Angle Bisector Theorem:</b>
					<br/>The angle bisector of any exterior angle of a triangle divides the side opposite to the angle (externally) in the ratio of the remaining two sides.
					<br/>-------diagram --------
					<br/>In ∆ ABC, CD is the exterior angle bisector, Here, CA/CB=  BD/CD
					<br/><b>•	Appollonius Theorem:</b>
					<br/>The sum of squares of any two sides of a triangle is equal to twice the sum of the square of the median to the third side and square of half the third side:
					<br/>-------diagram --------
					<br/>AD is the median of ∆ ABC. AB<sup>2</sup> + AC<sup>2</sup> = 2(AD<sup>2</sup> + DC<sup>2</sup>)

					<br/><b>Circumference(c):</b>
					<br/>The circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle. It contains 360° at the circle. The value of circumference is equal to 2πr. C = 2πr, where π = 22/7 = 3.1416
					<br/><b>Secant:</b>
					<br/>A secant is a line, which intersects the circle in two distinct points.
					<br/><b>Chord:</b>
					<br/>A chord is a segment whose endpoints lie on the circle. 
					<br/><b>Diameter(d):</b>
					<br/>The diameter is the chord passing through the center of the circle. The length of the diameter of a circle is twice the radius of the circle.  Diameter is the largest chord of the circle.
					<br/><b>Tangent:</b>
					<br/>Tangent is a line in the plane of a circle and having one and only one point common with the circle. The common point is called the point of contact.
					<br/><b>Semicircle:</b>
					<br/>Half of a circle cut off by a diameter is called the semicircle. 
					<br/><b>Arc:</b>
					<br/>An arc is a part of a circle. A minor arc is an arc less  than a semicircle and a major arc is an arc greater than a semi circle.
					<br/><b>Central Angle:</b>
					<br/>An angle in the plane of the circle with its vertex at the centre is called a central angle.

					<br/><b>1.	Congruent Circles:</b>
					<br/>Circles with equal radius are called congruent circles.
					<br/><b>2.	Concentric Circles</b>
					<br/>Circles lying in the same plane with a common centre are called concentric circles.

					<br/><b>Chords</b>
					<br/>1.	The perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord bisect the chord.
					<br/>--------diagram--------
					<br/>2.	Equal chords of a centre or congruent circles are equidistant from the centre.
					<br/>--------diagram--------
					<br/>If AB = CD, then OM = ON. Conversely, two chords of a circle or congruent circles that are equidistant from the centre are equal. If OM = ON, then AB = CD.
					<br/>3.	In a circle or congruent circles, equal chords subtend equal angles at the centre. If AB = CD, then m ∠ COD = m∠ AOB.
					<br/>--------diagram--------
					<br/>Conversely, chords, which subtend equal angles at the centre of the same or congruent circles, are equal. If  m ∠ COD = m∠ AOB, then AB = CD

					<br/>6.	If two circles touch externally, then distance between their centers = Sum of their radius. Distance between centers = O1P + O2P
					<br/>--------diagram--------
					<br/>If two circles touch internally, then they have only one common tangent. Distance between their centers = Difference of their radius. Distance between centers = O1P - O2P
					<br/>7.	For two circles with Centers O1 and O2 and radius of r1 and r2 for two circles. Then, Length of Direct Common Tangent = √((distance between centers)<sup>2</sup> – (r1-r2)<sup>2</sup> )

					<br/><b>Tangent – Secant – Chord Properties</b>
					<br/>1.	The angle subtended by a diameter.
					<br/>	a)	A diameter of a circle subtends an obtuse angle at a point in the interior of the circle.
					<br/>	b)	A diameter of a circle subtends an acute angle at a point in the exterior of the circle.
					<br/>	c)	A diameter of a circle subtends a right angle at a point on the circle.
					<br/>--------diagram--------
					<br/>Conversely, if a chord subtends a right angle at a point on the circle, then the chord is diameter of the circle.
					<br/>2.	Angles inscribed in the same arc are equal and vice versa.
					<br/>--------diagram--------
					<br/>3.	If a line segment joining 2 points subtends equal angles at two other points lying on the same side of the line containing the segment, then the four points lie on the same circle.
					<br/>4.	Equal arcs of a circle or congruent circles have equal chords. 
					<br/>--------diagram--------
					<br/>If m(arc AB) = m (arc CD), then AB = CD. Conversely, equal chords of a circle or congruent circles have their corresponding arcs equal. If AB = CD, then m(arc AB) = m (arc CD)
					<br/>5.	Inscribed Angle Theorem: - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. 
					<br/>--------diagram--------
					<br/>m∠APB = ½ m (Arc AB) = ½ m ∠ AOB
					<br/>6.	Alternate Segment Theorem:- The angle formed by a tangent and secant is half the intercepted arc.
					<br/>--------diagram--------
					<br/>m ∠ AEC = m ∠ CDE
					<br/>7.	If two secants intersect in the exterior of a circle, the angle so formed is equal to half the difference of the measure of the arcs intercepted by them.
					<br/>--------diagram--------
					<br/>m ∠ CAE = ½ [m (arc CE – arc BD]
					<br/>8.	If two secants intersect in the interior of the circle, the angle so formed is equal to half the sum of the measure of the arcs intercepted by them.
					<br/>--------diagram--------
					<br/>m ∠ AEB = ½ [m (arc CD + arc AB]
					<br/>9.	If a tangent and a secant intersect in the exterior of a circle, the angle so formed is equal to half the difference of the measure of the arc intercepted by them.

					<br/>m ∠ APD = ½ [m (arc AD – arc BD]
					<br/>10.	If PD is a tangent and AP is a secant intersecting the circle at B, then PD<sup>2</sup>=PB X PA

					<br/>Therefore, his quoted price = cost price + mark up

					<br/>Now, the merchant offers a discount of 20% on his quoted price
