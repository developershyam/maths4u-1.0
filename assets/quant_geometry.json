					<br/><b>Polygons:</b>
					<br/>Polygons are many-sided figures, with sides that are line segments. Polygons are named according to the number of sides and angles they have.
					<br/><b>Properties of Polygon:</b>
					<br/>A polygon with equal sides is called 'Regular Polygon'.
					<br/>The segment joining any two non-consecutive vertices is called a diagonal.
					<br/>Number of diagonals of a polygon with n sides = (n (n-3))/2
					<br/>For ex. In a Octagon number of diagonals will be (8 (8-3))/2 = 20
					<br/>Sum of all interior angles of a n-gon (polygon of n sides n) is given by (n-2)180°
					<br/>Hence, each interior angle of a regular n-gon = ( (n-2)180°)/n
					<br/>Sum of an interior angle and its adjacent exterior angle is 180°.
					<br/>Sum of all exterior angles of polygon is 360°
					<br/>For a regular polygon, each exterior angle =(360°)/n
					<br/>In a regular Pentagon each interior angle is 108° and each exterior angle is 72°.
					<br/>In a regular Pentagon each interior angle is 120° and each exterior angle is 60°.
					<br/><b>Quadrilaterals:</b>
					<br/>A polygon of four sides is called quadrilateral. The sum of measures of all angles of a quadrilateral is 360°.
					<br/><b>Types of Quadrilaterals:</b>
				   <br/><b>1.	Parallelogram:</b> A quadrilateral is called parallelogram, if its opposite sides are parallel.
				   <br/>  •  Opposite sides are parallel and congruent.				  
				   <br/>  •  Opposite angles are congruent.
				   <br/>  •  Diagonals bisect each other.
				   <br/>  •  Sum of any two adjacent angles is 180°.
				   <br/>  •  Each diagonal divides the parallelogram into 2 triangles of equal area.
				   <br/>  •  Straight lines joining the midpoints of the adjacent sides of any quadrilateral from a parallelogram.
				   <br/>  •  Sum of the squares of the diagonals is equal to the sum of squares of the 4 sides of a parallelogram.
				   <br/>     AC<sup>2</sup>+ BD<sup>2</sup>  = AB<sup>2</sup>+ BC<sup>2</sup>+ CD<sup>2</sup>+ AD<sup>2</sup>=2(AB<sup>2</sup>+ AC<sup>2</sup>)	
				   <br/>  •  Parallelograms that lie on the same base and between the same parallel lines are equal in area.
				   <br/>  •  If  a triangle and parallelogram lie on the same base and between the same parallel lines,  Area (triangle) = 1/2 Area (Parallelogram)
				   <br/>  •  If midpoints of the adjacent sides of a parallelogram are joined, a parallelogram is formed.
				   <br/><b>2.	Rectangle:</b> A parallelogram, in which each angle is a right angle is called rectangle. 
				   <br/>  •  Opposite sides are parallel and congruent.
				   <br/>  •  Each angle is equal to 90°
				   <br/>  •  Diagonal are congruent and bisect each other.
				   <br/>  •  If midpoints of the adjacent sides of a rectangle are joined, a rhombus is formed.
				   <br/><b>3.	Rhombus:</b> A parallelogram in which all sides are congruent is called Rhombus.
				   <br/>  •	 Opposite sides are parallel.
				   <br/>  •	 All sides are congruent.
				   <br/>  •	 Opposite angles are congruent.
				   <br/>  •	 Diagonals bisect at right angles side<sup>2</sup>=(1/2  one diagonal)<sup>2</sup>+ (1/2  other diagonal)<sup>2</sup>  
				   <br/>  •	 A parallelogram is a rhombus if its diagonals are perpendicular to each other.
				   <br/>  •	 If midpoints of the adjacent sides of a rhombus are joined, a rectangle is formed.
				   <br/><b>4.	Square:</b> A rectangle in which all sides are congruent is called a squire.
				   <br/>  •	 All sides are congruent and opposite sides are parallel.
				   <br/>  •	 All angles are 90°.
				   <br/>  •	 The diagonals are congruent and bisect each other at right angles.
				   <br/>  •	 Diagonal = √2 X side
				   <br/>  •	 A parallelogram is a square if its diagonals are congruent and bisect each other at right angles.
				   <br/>  •	 If midpoints of the adjacent sides of a square are joined, a square is formed.
				   <br/><b>5.	Trapezium:</b> A quadrilateral is called a trapezium, if two of the opposite sides are parallel but the other sides are not.
				   <br/>  •	 The segment joining the midpoints of the oblique (non parallel) sides is called median of the trapezium.
                   <br/>  •	 Median = 1/2 X sum of parallel sides
				   <br/><b>6.	Kite:</b> A quadrilateral is called a kite, if it has two pairs of equal and adjacent sides.
                   <br/>  •	 Two pairs of adjacent sides are congruent.
                   <br/>  •	 The diagonals intersect at right angles.

					 <br/>The extra time that the train takes when crossing the platform is on account of the extra distance that it has to cover = length of the platform.

					 "explanation14":
					 "
					 <br/>When a train overtakes another object such as a motorbike, whose length is negligible compared to the length of the train, then the distance traveled by the train while overtaking the motorbike is the same as the length of the train.
					<br/>The length of the train = distance traveled by the train while overtaking the motorbike 
					<br/>= relative speed between the train and the motorbike * time taken
					<br/>In this case, as both the objects i.e., the train and the motorbike are moving in the same direction, the relative speed between them = difference between their respective speeds = 100 - 64 = 36 kmph.
					<br/>Distance traveled by the train while overtaking the motorbike = 36 kmph * 40 seconds.
					<br/>The final answer is given in meters and the speed is given in kmph and the time in seconds. 
					<br/>So let us convert the given speed from kmph to m/sec.
					<br/>1 kmph = (5/18) m/sec
					<br/>Therefore, 36 kmph = 36 * (5 /18) = 10 m/sec.
