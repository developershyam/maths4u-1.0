					<br/>The questions on direction sense typically involve a person moving certain distances in specified directions. Then, the student is asked to find out the distances between the initial and the final points. The easier way of solving these problems is to draw a diagram as you read the information given in the problem and ensure that the diagram reflects all the information given the problem.
					<br/>To solve these types of problems, the student should be aware of directions. The student should also recognize the left and right of a person walking in  a particular direction. The following diagram shows all the directions and Left (L) and Right (R) of a person walking in that direction.

					<br/>			      |
					<br/>			    South
					<br/><b>Important Points:-</b>
					<br/>  *	The distance from a particular point after travelling a distance of x meters in the horizontal direction and a distance of y meters in the vertical direction is equal to âˆš(x<sup>2</sup>+ y<sup>2</sup> )
					<br/>  *	In common usage, North South direction is referred to 'Vertical' Direction and the East West direction is referred to as the 'Horizontal' direction.
