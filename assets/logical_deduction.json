					<br/>The phenomenon of deriving a conclusion from a single proposition or a set of given propositions, is known as logical deduction. The given propositions are also referred to as the premises.
					<br/><b>Two Inferential Processes of Deduction:</b>
					<br/><b>I. Immediate Deductive Inference:-</b>
					<br/>Here, conclusion is deduced from one of the given propositions, by any of the three ways -conversion, obversion and contraposition.
					<br/><b>1. Conversion:-</b> 
					<br/>The Conversion proceeds with interchanging the subject term and the predicate term i.e. the subject term of the premise becomes the predicate term of the conclusion and the predicate term of the premise becomes the subject of the conclusion. The given proposition is called convertend, whereas the conclusion drawn from it is called its converse.
					<br/><b>Table of Valid Conversions</b>
					<br/>Convertend	Converse
					<br/>A: All S is P
					<br/>Ex. All pins are tops.	I: Some P is S
					<br/>Some tops are pins.
					<br/>E: No S is P.
					<br/>Ex. No fish is whale.	E: No P is S.
					<br/>No whale is fish.
					<br/>I: Some S is P.
					<br/>Ex. Some boys are poets.	I: Some P is S.
					<br/>Some poets are boys.
					<br/>O: Some S is not P.	No valid conversion
					<br/>Note that in a conversion, the quality remains the same and the quantity may change.
					<br/><b>2. Obversion:-</b> 
					<br/>In obversion, we change the quality of the proposition and replace the predicate term by its complement.
					<br/><b>Table of Valid Obversions</b>
					<br/>Obvertend	Obverse
					<br/>A: All birds are mammals.	E: No birds are non-mammals.
					<br/>E: No poets are singers.	A: All poets are non-singers.
					<br/>I: Some nurses are doctors.	O: Some nurses are not non-doctors.
					<br/>O: some politicians are not statesmen.	I: Some politicians are non-statesmen.
					<br/><b>3. Contraposition:-</b> 
					<br/>obtain the contrapositive of a statement, we first replace the subject and predicate terms in the proposition and then exchange both these terms with their complements.
					<br/><b>Table of Valid Contrapositions</b>
					<br/>Proposition	Contrapositive
					<br/>A: All birds are mammals.	A: All non-mammals are non-birds.
					<br/>   I: Some birds are mammals.	I: Some non-mammals are non-birds.
					<br/><b>II. Mediate Deductive Inference (SYLLOGISM):-</b> 
					<br/>First introduced by Aristotle, a Syllogism is a deductive argument in which conclusion has to be drawn from two propositions referred to as the premises.
					<br/><b>Example:-</b>
					<br/>1. All lotus are flowers.
					<br/>2. All flowers are beautiful.
					<br/>3. All lotus are beautiful.
					<br/>Clearly, the propositions 1 and 2 are the premises and the proposition 3, which follows from the first two propositions, is called the conclusion.
					<br/><b>Term :-</b> 
					<br/>Logic, a term is a word or a combination of words, which by itself can be used as a subject or predicate of a proposition.
					<br/>Syllogism is concerned with three terms :
					<br/><b>1.</b> Major Term : It is the predicate of the conclusion and is denoted by P (first letter of 'Predicate').
					<br/><b>2.</b> Minor Term: It is the subject of the conclusion and is denoted by S (first letter of 'Subject').
					<br/><b>3.</b> Middle Term: It is the term common to both the premises and is denoted by M (first letter of 'Middle').
					<br/><b>Example:-</b>
					<br/><b>Premises:-</b>
					<br/>1. All dogs are animals.
					<br/>2. All tigers are dogs.
					<br/><b>Conclusion :-</b>
					<br/>All tigers are animals.
					<br/>Here 'animals' is the predicate of the conclusion and so,.it is the major term. P.
					<br/>'Tigers' is the subject of the conclusion and so, it is the minor term, S.
					<br/>'Dogs' is the term common to both the premises and so, it is the middle term, M.
					<br/><b>Major And Minor Premises:-</b>
					<br/>Of the two premises, the major premise is that in which the middle term is the subject and the minor premise is that in which the middle term is the predicate.
					<br/><b>Rules for Deriving Conclusion:-</b>
					<br/>1.	The conclusion does not contain the middle term.
					<br/>2.	No term can be distributed in the conclusion unless it is distributed in the premises.
					<br/>3.	The middle term (M) should he distributed at least once in the premises. Otherwise, the conclusion cannot follow.
					<br/>4.	No conclusion follows
					<br/>   •	if both the premises are particular
					<br/>   •	if both the premises are negative.
					<br/>   •	if the major premise is particular and the minor premise is negative.
					<br/>5.	If the middle term is distributed twice, the conclusion cannot be universal.
					<br/>6.	If one premise is negative, the conclusion must be negative.
					<br/>7.	If one premise is particular, the conclusion must be particular.
					<br/>8.	If both the premises are affirmative, the conclusion must be affirmative.
					<br/>9.	If both the premises are universal, the conclusion must be universal.

					<b>Find 467 is prime or not?</b>
					<br/>Ans. We find by trial that 467 is not divisible by any of primes 2,5,7,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦.19,23. But on dividing by 23 we get a quotient less then 23, and we need not go further. For, if 467 contained a prime factor beyond 23, the quotient obtained on dividing 467 by that prime factor would be less than 23, and must have been revealed as a factor by the former trials. Hence, 467 has no prime factor greater or less than 23; that is, it is prime number. In general, to find whether a number is prime or not, we need to check whether it is divisible by any of the primes up to the square root of that number.
