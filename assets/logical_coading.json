					<br/>Before looking at the different types of questions and some of the codes that can be used with the help of examples, let us first understand what we mean by coding and decoding. When we say coding, a particular code or pattern is used to express a word in English language as a different word or in a different form. The coded word itself does not make any sense unless we know the patter or code that has been followed. Decoding refers to the process of arriving at the equivalent English word from the code word given.
					<br/>In the questions, a particular code is given and on the basis of this given code, we have to find out how another word ( In English language) can be coded. The correct code for the given word has to be selected from the answer choices on the basis of the code given in the question.

					[ {"example1":
					"
					<b>In a certain code, BOXER is written as AQWGQ. How VISIT is written in that code?</b>
					<br/>Letters at the odd places have been written one letter back, and letters at the even places have been written two letters ahead in the coded word as their positions in the alphabet.
					
					"},
					{"example2":
					"
					<b>In a certain code, INSTITUTION is written as NOITUTITSNI. How is PERFECTION written in that code?</b>
					<br/>Ans.Letters of the word INSTITUTION have been just reversed in the coded word. Therefore, PERFECTION will be coded as NOITCEFREP. Hence, option (4) is the correct answer.

					{"question1":"If in a certain language, MADRAS is coded as NBESBT, how is BOMBAY coded in that code ?", "answer1":"CPNCBZ", "option1":"CPNCBX;CPNCBZ;CPOCBZ;CQOCBZ",
					 "explanation1":
					 "
					 <br/>Each letter in the word is moved one step forward to obtain the corresponding letter of the code.
					 "},
					{"question2":"In a certain code, SIKKIM is written as THLJJL, how is TRAINING written in that code ?", "answer2":"UQBHOHOF", "option2":"SQBHOHOF;UQBHOIOF;UQBHOHOI;UQBHOHOF",
					 "explanation2":
					 "
					 <br/>In given word, word is increasing and decreasing by one alternatively as,
					<br/>S +1 T
					<br/>I -1 H
					<br/>K +1 L
					<br/>K -1 J
					<br/>I +1 J
					<br/>M -1 L
					<br/>So in the same way TRAINING will be UQBHOHOF
					 
					 "},
					 {"question3":"In a certain code, MENTION is written as LNEITNO. How is PATTERN written in that code ?", "answer3":"OTAETNR", "option3":"ATAETNR;OTAETNR;OTAESNR;STAETNR",
					 "explanation3":
					 "
					 <br/>In the given word, we can analyse that,
					<br/>M is decreased by 1, M-1 = L, and other words are interchanged,
					<br/>EN - NE
					<br/>TI - IT
					<br/>ON - NO
					<br/>So PATTERN will be
					<br/>P -1 O
					<br/>AT - TA
					<br/>TE - ET
					<br/>RN - NR					 
					 "},
					 {"question4":"In a code language if POSE is coded as OQNPRTDF, then the word TYPE will be coded as", "answer4":"SUXZOQDF", "option4":"SUXZOQFD;SUXZQOFD;SUXZOQDF;SUXZQODE",
					 "explanation4":
					 "
					 <br/>The word has been coded in such as way that codes for letter P are OQ (One letter behind and one letter ahead of P in alphabet). Similarly, codes for O are NP and so on.
					 "},
					 {"question5":"In a certain code, BOXER is written as AQWGQ. How VISIT is written in that code?", "answer5":"UKRKS", "option5":"UKRKU;UKRKS;WKRKU;WKRKS",
					 "explanation5":
					 "
					 <br/>Letters at the odd places have been written one letter back, and letters at the even places have been written two letters ahead in the coded word as their positions in the alphabet.
					 "},
					 {"question6":"In a certain code, BOY is written as $*� and HOUR is written @*�0. How is RUBY written in that code?", "answer6":"0 � $ �", "option6":"0 � $ �;0 $ � �;� $ � 0;� � $ 0",
					 "explanation6":
					 "
					 <br/>It is clear from the coding pattern that codes for R, U, B and Y are 0, �, $ and �, respectively.
					 "},
					 {"question7":"In a certain code, INSTITUTION is written as NOITUTITSNI. How is PERFECTION written in that code?", "answer7":"NOITCEFREP", "option7":"NOICTEFREP;NOITCEFERP;NOITCEFRPE;NOITCEFREP",
					 "explanation7":
					 "
					 <br/>Letters of the word INSTITUTION have been just reversed in the coded word. Therefore, PERFECTION will be coded as NOITCEFREP. Hence, option (4) is the correct answer.
					 "},
					 {"question8":"If FESTIVAL is coded as MBWJUTFG, then OPIUM would be coded as", "answer8":"NVJQP", "option8":"NOHTL;NTHNO;NVJQP;MUIPO",
					 "explanation8":
					 "
					 <br/>The word has been coded in such a way that last letter in the coded word is the next letter of the first letter of the basic word, second letter is next that of the second letter of the basic word and so on. Hence, OPIUM will be coded as NVJQP.
					 "},
					 {"question9":"In a certain code, RIPPLE is written as 613382 and LIFE is written as 8192. How is PILLER written in that code?", "answer9":"318826", "option9":"318826;318286;618826;328816",
					 "explanation9":
					 "
					 <br/>From the coding pattern, it is clear that code for P is 3, for I is 1, for L is 8, for E is 2, and for R it is 6. So word PILLER will coded as 318826.
					 "},
					 {"question10":"In a certain code SOCIAL is written as TQFMFR, then how you will code DIMPLE?", "answer10":"EKPTQK", "option10":"EKPTQK;EKPQPJ;EKPSPJ;EKPSOH",
					 "explanation10":
					 "
					 <br/>Letters for the basic word have been moved in forward direction in the coded word with a gap of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 letters as their positions in the alphabet. Therefore, the word DIMPLE will be coded as E K P T Q K.
					 "},
					 {"question11":"In a certain code language, QUEUE is written as Q 22, and CHURCH is written as 1UR1. Which of the following would be most appropriate code for BANANA in that language?", "answer11":"B55A", "option11":"B5A5;5N5A;B55A;BA5A5A",
					 "explanation11":
					 "
					 <br/>Similar pairs of letters have been given the same numeric in each word. As a result pair UE in word QUEUE has been coded 2, pair CH has been coded 1 and likewise the pair AN has been coded 5. Hence, the word BANANA would be coded as B55A.
					 "},
					 {"question12":"If LINGER is 123456 and FORCE is 56789, then FIERCE is", "answer12":"456678", "option12":"345667;456678;345677;556789",
					 "explanation12":
					 "
					 <br/>Letters R, E are common to LINGER and FORCE, and numbers 6 and 5 are common to their respective coding. Therefore, 5 and 6 will stand for RE but not respectively. Now, since word FIERCE has double E, therefore, either of 5 and 6 will appear twice in its coding. Besides, coding of FIERCE will have two numbers from coding of FORCE for letters F and C, and one number from coding of LINGER for letter I. Hence, coding of FIERCE will be 456678.

					 {"question13":"If PAINTER is written in a code language as NCGPRGP, then REASON would be written as", "answer13":"PGYUMP", "option13":"PCYQMN;PGYQMN;PGYUMP;PGYUPM",
					 "explanation13":
					 "
					 <br/>Letters at odd places have been written two letters back, and letters at even places have been written two steps ahead in the coded word, as their positions in the alphabet. Hence, word REASON will be coded as PGYUMP.
					 "},
					 {"question14":"If PICTURE is coded as tuvwxyz, then PATCH would be coded as", "answer14":"tqwvm", "option14":"wtzyv;twxyz;tqwvm;mtuvw",
					 "explanation14":
					 "
					 <br/>Codes for P, T and C will be t, w and v respectively (direct coding), and codes for A and H will be letters other than which have appeared in coding of PICTURE. Hence, PATCH will be coded as tqwvm.
					 "},
					 {"question15":"In a code, CORNER is written as GSVRIV. How can CENTRAL be written in that code?", "answer15":"GIRXVEP", "option15":"DFOUSBM;GIRXVEP;GNFJKER;GNKJFER",
					 "explanation15":
					 "
					 <br/>Each letter of word is moved 4 steps forward to obtain the code.
