					<br/>A central value around which a group of values show a tendency to concentrate is called an “Average”. It is measured in many ways. (See example 1)
					<br/><b>1.	Mode:-</b> Mode is the number that occurs most frequently in a given set of numbers.
					<br/>Ex.  As in set (2,4,4,5,78,4,6,4,7,4,6,2,6) mode is “4” as is occurs maximum (5) times.
					<br/><b>2.	Median:-</b> 	Median is the middle value of a group of numbers arranged in ascending or descending order. If the number of values (n) is odd, then median is (n+1)/2th term.
					<br/><b>3.	Arithmetic Mean</b>	The most commonly used average is arithmetic mean (AM). The arithmetic mean of n numbers is sum of all n term divided by no. of terms (n).  It is denoted by x ⃖.x ⃖ =(x1+x2+⋯…+xn)/n = (∑_(i=1)^n▒xi)/n
					<br/>If the values x1,x2,……xn are asigned weights w1, w2,………,wn respectively, then Weighted arithmetic mean/ Arithmetic Mean =(w1x1+w2x2+⋯…+wnxn)/(w1+w2+⋯…..+wn) (See Example 2)
					<br/><b>4.	Geometric Mean</b>	: Geometric mean (GM) of n numbers x1,x2,……xn is nth root of their products i.e. GM = √(n&x1 X x2 X……….Xxn) (See Example 3)
					<br/><b>5. Harmonic Mean</b>:  Harmonic mean of n numbers x1,x2,……xn is calculated as  n/(1/x1+ 1/x2+ ……1/xn  ). The HM of aand b is 2ab/(a+b)

					<br/>When a sum of money is lent by A to B, A is called the lender (creditor), B the borrower (debtor). The sum lent is called the principal (P).Interest (I) is the extra money paid by the borrower to lender for the use of money for a specified time.Time for which the money is borrowed is called period (N).
					The interest paid per 100 in a year is called rate % per annum (R).Sum of Interest (I) and principal is called Amount (A); A = P+I

					<br/><b>Simple Interest (SI):-</b>
					<br/>When interest is paid as it falls due, it is called simple interest, i.e., throughout the loan period, interest is charged on the original sum (prinicipal) borrowed:
					<br/>SI = PNR/100
					<br/><br/><b>Compound Interest (CI):-</b>
					<br/>When interest is added to the principal over a fix period of time, and new interest is calculated on this increased principal, The differenence between the amount and money borrowed is called compound interest.					
					<br/>Case 1:- When interest is compounded annually.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/100)]^N
					<br/>Case 2: When interest is compounded half yearly.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/200)]^2N
					<br/>Case 3: When interest is compounded quarterly.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/400)]^4N
					<br/>Case 3: When interest is compounded quarterly.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/400)]^4N
					
					<br/><b>Important Application</b>
					<br/><b>1:-</b> In CI when rates are different for different years, say R1, R2, R3 then
					<br/>A = P(1+ R1/100)(1+R2/100)(1+R3/100)
					<br/><b>2:-</b> Value of machine or any other object decrease with time. This decrease is called depreication.
					<br/> Thus if U is the value at a certain time and R% per annum is the rate of depreciation, then the value V at the end of N years
					<br/>V = U[1- (R/100)]^N
					<br/><b>3:-</b> The original population of a town is P and the annual increase is R%, then the population of the town in N years
					<br/>=P[1+(R/100)]^N
					<br/>If the population decreases by R %, then the population of the town in N years 
					<br/>= P[1- (R/100)]^N
					<br/><b>4:-</b> In hire purchase, the amound paid at the time of purchase is called down payment. The remainder is paid in equal monthly installments
					<br/>Monthly Installment  = (Amount to be paid  - Down payment)/ Number of installments

					<br/>Ex. 2/5 = (2/5)*100 = 40%
					<br/><b>2:-</b> To increase a number by a given rate (%), multiply the number to (100+ rate)/100.

					<b>The speed of a body is defined as the distance covered by it in unit time.</b>

					<br/><b>1:-</b> If a body travels d1, d2,d3…..dn distances at a speed of s1,s2,s3...sn km/hr,  in time t1, t2,t3……tn, then the average speed  = (Total Distance Travelled)/(Total Time Taken) = (d1+d2+d3+⋯..dn)/(t1+t2+t3+⋯..tn).
					<br/><br/><b>2:-</b> If a certain distance d, from A to B, is covered at ‘a’ km/hr and the same distance is covered again from B to A in ‘b’ km/hr, then the average speed during whole journey= 2ab/((a+b)) km/hr. 
					<br/>Also, if  t1 and t2 is the time taken to travel from A to B and B to A, respectively, the distance ‘d’ from A to B is given by:
					<br/> d= (t1+t2) 2ab/((a+b))  
					<br/> d= (t1-t2) 2ab/((a-b))  
					<br/> d= (a-b) t1t2/((t1-t2))  
					<br/><br/><b>3:-</b> While travelling a certain distance , if a man changes his speed in the ratio m:n, then the ratio of time becomes n:m.
					<br/><br/><b>4:-</b> If two person A and B start at the same time in opposite directions from two points and arrive at the two points in ‘a’ and ‘b’ hrs, respectively after having met, then.
					<br/>(A's Speed)/(B's Speed)  = √b/√a

					<br/><b>Cases:-</b>
					<br/><br/><b>Case 1 : </b> When one object is stationary and other is moving.
					<br>Relative speed of stationary object and moving object = Speed of the moving object
					<br/><br/><b>Case 2 : </b>When two objects are moving in opposite direction
					<br/>Relative speed  = Sum of their speeds
					<br/><br/><b>Case 3 : </b> When two objects are moving in same direction
					<br/>Relative speed  = Difference of their speeds
					<br/><br/><b>Important Points:-</b>
					<br/><b>1:-</b> Time taken by a moving object ‘x’meters long in passing a stationary object ‘y’ meters long from the time they meet, is same as the time taken by the moving object to cover ‘x+y’ meters with its own speed.
