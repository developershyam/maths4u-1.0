					<br/>A central value around which a group of values show a tendency to concentrate is called an “Average”. It is measured in many ways. (See example 1)
					<br/><b>1.	Mode:-</b> Mode is the number that occurs most frequently in a given set of numbers.
					<br/>Ex.  As in set (2,4,4,5,78,4,6,4,7,4,6,2,6) mode is “4” as is occurs maximum (5) times.
					<br/><b>2.	Median:-</b> 	Median is the middle value of a group of numbers arranged in ascending or descending order. If the number of values (n) is odd, then median is (n+1)/2th term.
					<br/><b>3.	Arithmetic Mean</b>	The most commonly used average is arithmetic mean (AM). The arithmetic mean of n numbers is sum of all n term divided by no. of terms (n).  It is denoted by x ⃖.x ⃖ =(x1+x2+⋯…+xn)/n = (∑_(i=1)^n▒xi)/n
					<br/>If the values x1,x2,……xn are asigned weights w1, w2,………,wn respectively, then Weighted arithmetic mean/ Arithmetic Mean =(w1x1+w2x2+⋯…+wnxn)/(w1+w2+⋯…..+wn) (See Example 2)
					<br/><b>4.	Geometric Mean</b>	: Geometric mean (GM) of n numbers x1,x2,……xn is nth root of their products i.e. GM = √(n&x1 X x2 X……….Xxn) (See Example 3)
					<br/><b>5. Harmonic Mean</b>:  Harmonic mean of n numbers x1,x2,……xn is calculated as  n/(1/x1+ 1/x2+ ……1/xn  ). The HM of aand b is 2ab/(a+b)

					<br/>When a sum of money is lent by A to B, A is called the lender (creditor), B the borrower (debtor). The sum lent is called the principal (P).Interest (I) is the extra money paid by the borrower to lender for the use of money for a specified time.Time for which the money is borrowed is called period (N).
					The interest paid per 100 in a year is called rate % per annum (R).Sum of Interest (I) and principal is called Amount (A); A = P+I

					<br/><b>Simple Interest (SI):-</b>
					<br/>When interest is paid as it falls due, it is called simple interest, i.e., throughout the loan period, interest is charged on the original sum (prinicipal) borrowed:
					<br/>SI = PNR/100
					<br/><br/><b>Compound Interest (CI):-</b>
					<br/>When interest is added to the principal over a fix period of time, and new interest is calculated on this increased principal, The differenence between the amount and money borrowed is called compound interest.					
					<br/>Case 1:- When interest is compounded annually.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/100)]^N
					<br/>Case 2: When interest is compounded half yearly.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/200)]^2N
					<br/>Case 3: When interest is compounded quarterly.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/400)]^4N
					<br/>Case 3: When interest is compounded quarterly.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/400)]^4N
					
					<br/><b>Important Application</b>
					<br/><b>1:-</b> In CI when rates are different for different years, say R1, R2, R3 then
					<br/>A = P(1+ R1/100)(1+R2/100)(1+R3/100)
					<br/><b>2:-</b> Value of machine or any other object decrease with time. This decrease is called depreication.
					<br/> Thus if U is the value at a certain time and R% per annum is the rate of depreciation, then the value V at the end of N years
					<br/>V = U[1- (R/100)]^N
					<br/><b>3:-</b> The original population of a town is P and the annual increase is R%, then the population of the town in N years
					<br/>=P[1+(R/100)]^N
					<br/>If the population decreases by R %, then the population of the town in N years 
					<br/>= P[1- (R/100)]^N
					<br/><b>4:-</b> In hire purchase, the amound paid at the time of purchase is called down payment. The remainder is paid in equal monthly installments

					<br/>The term percent means for every hundred. A fraction whose denominator is 100 called a percentage and the numerator of the fraction is called the rate percent. It is denoted as symbol %
					<br/><b>Important Applications:-</b> 
					<br/><b>1:-</b> To find % equivalent of a fraction or decimal, multiply that fraction/decimal to 100.
					<br/>Ex. 2/5 = (2/5)*100 = 40%
					<br/><b>2:-</b> To increase a number by a given rate (%), multiply the number to (100+ rate)/100.
					<br/>Ex. Increase 40 by 30% = 40X (100+30)/100 = 40X130/100 = 52					
					<br/><b>3:-</b> To decrease a number by a given rate (%), multiply the number to (100- rate)/100.
					<br/>Ex. Decrease 40 by 30% = 40X (100-30)/100 = 40X70/100 = 28					
					<br/><b>4:-</b> % increase of a number = (Total Increase/ Initial Value) X 100.
					<br/>Ex. Price of Car has been increased from 400,000 to 500,000, find the % increase. = [(500,000-400,000)/400,000] X 100 = (100,000/400,000)X100 = 25%
					<br/><b>5:-</b>% decrease of a number = (Total Decrease/ Initial Value) X 100
					<br/>Ex. Price of Dell Laptop has Fallen from 25,000 to 20,000, find the % decrease. = [(25,000-20,000)/25,000] X 100 = (5,000/25,000)X100 = 20%
					<br/><b>6:-</b>If the present value of a machine is P and it depreciates by r% anually, the value of machine after n years is = P*[(1-(R/100))^n]
					<br/><b>7:-</b>If A's income is r% more than of B, then B's income is less than of A by [(r/(100+r))*100]%
					<br/><b>8:-</b>If A's income is r% less than of B, then B's income is more than of A by [(r/(100-r))*100]%
					<br/><b>9:-</b> If the price of a commodity increase by r% then reduction in consumption, so as not to increase the expenditure is [(r/(100+r))*100]%
					<br/><b>10:-</b>If the price of a commodity decrease by r% then increasae in consumption, so as not to decrease the expenditure is [(r/(100-r))*100]%

					<br/>The price at which a person buys a product is the cost price of the product, known as CP
					<br/>The price at which a person sells a product is the Sales price of the product, known as SP.
					<br/>If SP>CP, the difference, SP-CP is known as profit or gain.
					<br/>Profit = SP-CP
					<br/>Profit % = (Profit/CP)*100 (see example 1)

					<br/>1. IF an article is sold at a profit of x% SP = (100+x)% of CP
					<br/>2. IF an article is sold at a loss of y% SP = (100-x)% of CP
					<br/>3. When a person sells 2 items of same cost as 1 at a profit of x% and other at a loss of x%, He will always incur loss. Loss% = x2/100
					<br/>4. If a shopkeeper sells his goods at C.P., but uses false weight of x kg, his profit is: Profit% = [True weight - False weight)/False weight]*100
					<br/>5. While selling goods, adding a certain percentage on the cost price is known as marked price, And  this % addition is known as percentage mark up.
					<br/>Marked Price = CP + Mark up
					<br/>Marked Price = CP + % Mark up on CP
					<br/>If discount is also given on this, Selling Price = Marked Price - % discount.

					<b>Relative Speed:-</b>
					<br/><b>Relative speed means the speed of an object A with respect to another object B, which may be stationary, moving (in the same direction or opposite direction)</b>
					<br/><b>Cases:-</b>
					<br/><br/><b>Case 1 : </b> When one object is stationary and other is moving.
					<br>Relative speed of stationary object and moving object = Speed of the moving object
					<br/><br/><b>Case 2 : </b>When two objects are moving in opposite direction
					<br/>Relative speed  = Sum of their speeds
					<br/><br/><b>Case 3 : </b> When two objects are moving in same direction
					<br/>Relative speed  = Difference of their speeds
					<br/><br/><b>Important Points:-</b>
					<br/><b>1:-</b> Time taken by a moving object ‘x’meters long in passing a stationary object ‘y’ meters long from the time they meet, is same as the time taken by the moving object to cover ‘x+y’ meters with its own speed.
					<br/><br/><b>2:-</b> If two objects of length ‘x’ and ‘y’ meters move in the same direction or in opposite direction at ‘a’ and ‘b’ m/s, then the time taken to cross each other  from the time they meet. 
					<br/> = (Sum of their length)/(Relative Speed)  
					<br/> = (x+y)/(a-b)  (In case of same direction)  
					<br/> = (x+y)/(a+b)  (In case of opposite direction)
					<br/><br/><b>3:-</b> If the speed of a boat in still water is x km/hr and the speed of the stream is y km/hr speed while travelling with the stream i.e., speed downstream = (x+y) km/hr speed while travelling against the stream i.e., speed upstream = (x-y) km/hr.
					<br/><br/><b>4:-</b> Speed of the boat in still water =1/2(Speed with Stream + Speed against stream) 
					<br/>    Speed of the river =1/2(Speed with Stream - Speed against stream).
