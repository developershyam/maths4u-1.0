					<br/>A central value around which a group of values show a tendency to concentrate is called an â€œAverageâ€�. It is measured in many ways. (See example 1)
					<br/><b>1.	Mode:-</b> Mode is the number that occurs most frequently in a given set of numbers.
					<br/>Ex.  As in set (2,4,4,5,78,4,6,4,7,4,6,2,6) mode is â€œ4â€� as is occurs maximum (5) times.
					<br/><b>2.	Median:-</b> 	Median is the middle value of a group of numbers arranged in ascending or descending order. If the number of values (n) is odd, then median is (n+1)/2th term.
					<br/><b>3.	Arithmetic Mean</b>	The most commonly used average is arithmetic mean (AM). The arithmetic mean of n numbers is sum of all n term divided by no. of terms (n).  It is denoted by x âƒ–.x âƒ– =(x1+x2+â‹¯â€¦+xn)/n = (âˆ‘_(i=1)^nâ–’xi)/n
					<br/>If the values x1,x2,â€¦â€¦xn are asigned weights w1, w2,â€¦â€¦â€¦,wn respectively, then Weighted arithmetic mean/ Arithmetic Mean =(w1x1+w2x2+â‹¯â€¦+wnxn)/(w1+w2+â‹¯â€¦..+wn) (See Example 2)
					<br/><b>4.	Geometric Mean</b>	: Geometric mean (GM) of n numbers x1,x2,â€¦â€¦xn is nth root of their products i.e. GM = âˆš(n&x1 X x2 Xâ€¦â€¦â€¦.Xxn) (See Example 3)
					<br/><b>5. Harmonic Mean</b>:  Harmonic mean of n numbers x1,x2,â€¦â€¦xn is calculated as  n/(1/x1+ 1/x2+ â€¦â€¦1/xn  ). The HM of aand b is 2ab/(a+b)

					<br/>When a sum of money is lent by A to B, A is called the lender (creditor), B the borrower (debtor). The sum lent is called the principal (P).Interest (I) is the extra money paid by the borrower to lender for the use of money for a specified time.Time for which the money is borrowed is called period (N).
					The interest paid per 100 in a year is called rate % per annum (R).Sum of Interest (I) and principal is called Amount (A); A = P+I

					<br/><b>Simple Interest (SI):-</b>
					<br/>When interest is paid as it falls due, it is called simple interest, i.e., throughout the loan period, interest is charged on the original sum (prinicipal) borrowed:
					<br/>SI = PNR/100
					<br/><br/><b>Compound Interest (CI):-</b>
					<br/>When interest is added to the principal over a fix period of time, and new interest is calculated on this increased principal, The differenence between the amount and money borrowed is called compound interest.					
					<br/>Case 1:- When interest is compounded annually.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/100)]^N
					<br/>Case 2: When interest is compounded half yearly.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/200)]^2N
					<br/>Case 3: When interest is compounded quarterly.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/400)]^4N
					<br/>Case 3: When interest is compounded quarterly.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/400)]^4N
					
					<br/><b>Important Application</b>
					<br/><b>1:-</b> In CI when rates are different for different years, say R1, R2, R3 then
					<br/>A = P(1+ R1/100)(1+R2/100)(1+R3/100)
					<br/><b>2:-</b> Value of machine or any other object decrease with time. This decrease is called depreication.
					<br/> Thus if U is the value at a certain time and R% per annum is the rate of depreciation, then the value V at the end of N years
					<br/>V = U[1- (R/100)]^N
					<br/><b>3:-</b> The original population of a town is P and the annual increase is R%, then the population of the town in N years
					<br/>=P[1+(R/100)]^N
					<br/>If the population decreases by R %, then the population of the town in N years 
					<br/>= P[1- (R/100)]^N
					<br/><b>4:-</b> In hire purchase, the amound paid at the time of purchase is called down payment. The remainder is paid in equal monthly installments

					<br/>The term percent means for every hundred. A fraction whose denominator is 100 called a percentage and the numerator of the fraction is called the rate percent. It is denoted as symbol %
					<br/><b>Important Applications:-</b> 
					<br/><b>1:-</b> To find % equivalent of a fraction or decimal, multiply that fraction/decimal to 100.
					<br/>Ex. 2/5 = (2/5)*100 = 40%
					<br/><b>2:-</b> To increase a number by a given rate (%), multiply the number to (100+ rate)/100.
					<br/>Ex. Increase 40 by 30% = 40X (100+30)/100 = 40X130/100 = 52					
					<br/><b>3:-</b> To decrease a number by a given rate (%), multiply the number to (100- rate)/100.
					<br/>Ex. Decrease 40 by 30% = 40X (100-30)/100 = 40X70/100 = 28					
					<br/><b>4:-</b> % increase of a number = (Total Increase/ Initial Value) X 100.
					<br/>Ex. Price of Car has been increased from 400,000 to 500,000, find the % increase. = [(500,000-400,000)/400,000] X 100 = (100,000/400,000)X100 = 25%
					<br/><b>5:-</b>% decrease of a number = (Total Decrease/ Initial Value) X 100
					<br/>Ex. Price of Dell Laptop has Fallen from 25,000 to 20,000, find the % decrease. = [(25,000-20,000)/25,000] X 100 = (5,000/25,000)X100 = 20%
					<br/><b>6:-</b>If the present value of a machine is P and it depreciates by r% anually, the value of machine after n years is = P*[(1-(R/100))^n]
					<br/><b>7:-</b>If A's income is r% more than of B, then B's income is less than of A by [(r/(100+r))*100]%
					<br/><b>8:-</b>If A's income is r% less than of B, then B's income is more than of A by [(r/(100-r))*100]%
					<br/><b>9:-</b> If the price of a commodity increase by r% then reduction in consumption, so as not to increase the expenditure is [(r/(100+r))*100]%
					<br/><b>10:-</b>If the price of a commodity decrease by r% then increasae in consumption, so as not to decrease the expenditure is [(r/(100-r))*100]%

					 <br/>Let the marked price be S and the cost price of the article be C
					<br/>When the merchant sells at 80% of marked price he sells at 0.8S
					<br/>This results in a loss of 12%.
					<br/>Loss is always computed as a percentage of cost price.
					<br/>Therefore, the loss incurred by the merchant = 0.12C

					<br/>Therefore, his quoted price = cost price + mark up

					<br/>Now, the merchant offers a discount of 20% on his quoted price

					 {"question14":"A train traveling at 100 kmph overtakes a motorbike traveling at 64 kmph in 40 seconds. What is the length of the train in meters?", "answer14":"400 meter", "option14":"1777 meter;1822 meter;400 meter;1100 meter",
					 "explanation14":
					 "
					 <br/>When a train overtakes another object such as a motorbike, whose length is negligible compared to the length of the train, then the distance traveled by the train while overtaking the motorbike is the same as the length of the train.
					<br/>The length of the train = distance traveled by the train while overtaking the motorbike 
					<br/>= relative speed between the train and the motorbike * time taken
					<br/>In this case, as both the objects i.e., the train and the motorbike are moving in the same direction, the relative speed between them = difference between their respective speeds = 100 - 64 = 36 kmph.
					<br/>Distance traveled by the train while overtaking the motorbike = 36 kmph * 40 seconds.
					<br/>The final answer is given in meters and the speed is given in kmph and the time in seconds. 
					<br/>So let us convert the given speed from kmph to m/sec.
					<br/>1 kmph = (5/18) m/sec
					<br/>Therefore, 36 kmph = 36 * (5 /18) = 10 m/sec.
					<br/>Relative speed = 10 m/sec. Time taken = 40 seconds.
					<br/>Therefore, distance traveled = 10 * 40 = 400 meters.

					 <br/>Let the speed of two trains be 7x and 8x km/hr.
