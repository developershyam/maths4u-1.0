					<br/>When a sum of money is lent by A to B, A is called the lender (creditor), B the borrower (debtor). The sum lent is called the principal (P).Interest (I) is the extra money paid by the borrower to lender for the use of money for a specified time.Time for which the money is borrowed is called period (N).
					The interest paid per 100 in a year is called rate % per annum (R).Sum of Interest (I) and principal is called Amount (A); A = P+I

					<br/><b>Simple Interest (SI):-</b>
					<br/>When interest is paid as it falls due, it is called simple interest, i.e., throughout the loan period, interest is charged on the original sum (prinicipal) borrowed:
					<br/>SI = PNR/100
					<br/><br/><b>Compound Interest (CI):-</b>
					<br/>When interest is added to the principal over a fix period of time, and new interest is calculated on this increased principal, The differenence between the amount and money borrowed is called compound interest.					
					<br/>Case 1:- When interest is compounded annually.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/100)]^N
					<br/>Case 2: When interest is compounded half yearly.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/200)]^2N
					<br/>Case 3: When interest is compounded quarterly.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/400)]^4N
					<br/>Case 3: When interest is compounded quarterly.
					<br/>A = P[1+(R/400)]^4N
					
					<br/><b>Important Application</b>
					<br/><b>1:- </b>
					<br/>In CI when rates are different for different years, say R1, R2, R3 then
					<br/>A = P(1+ R1/100)(1+R2/100)(1+R3/100)
					<br/><b>2:- </b>
					<br/>Value of machine or any other object decrease with time. This decrease is called depreication.
					<br/> Thus if U is the value at a certain time and R% per annum is the rate of depreciation, then the value V at the end of N years
					<br/>V = U[1- (R/100)]^N
					<br/><b>3:- </b>
					<br/>The original population of a town is P and the annual increase is R%, then the population of the town in N years
					<br/>=P[1+(R/100)]^N
					<br/>If the population decreases by R %, then the population of the town in N years 
					<br/>= P[1- (R/100)]^N
					<br/><b>4:- </b>
					<br/>In hire purchase, the amound paid at the time of purchase is called down payment. The remainder is paid in equal monthly installments
					<br/>Monthly Installment  = (Amount to be paid  - Down payment)/ Number of installments

					<b>The speed of a body is defined as the distance covered by it in unit time.</b>
					<br/><b>Speed = Distance/Time <br/>Time = Distance/Speed <br/> Distance = Speed X Time</b>
					<br/><br/><b>Important Points:-</b>
					<br/><b>1:-</b> If a body travels d1, d2,d3…..dn distances at a speed of s1,s2,s3...sn km/hr,  in time t1, t2,t3……tn, then the average speed  = (Total Distance Travelled)/(Total Time Taken) = (d1+d2+d3+⋯..dn)/(t1+t2+t3+⋯..tn).
					<br/><br/><b>2:-</b> If a certain distance d, from A to B, is covered at ‘a’ km/hr and the same distance is covered again from B to A in ‘b’ km/hr, then the average speed during whole journey= 2ab/((a+b)) km/hr. 
					<br/>Also, if  t1 and t2 is the time taken to travel from A to B and B to A, respectively, the distance ‘d’ from A to B is given by:
					<br/> d= (t1+t2) 2ab/((a+b))  
					<br/> d= (t1-t2) 2ab/((a-b))  
					<br/> d= (a-b) t1t2/((t1-t2))  
					<br/><br/><b>3:-</b> While travelling a certain distance , if a man changes his speed in the ratio m:n, then the ratio of time becomes n:m.
					<br/><br/><b>4:-</b> If two person A and B start at the same time in opposite directions from two points and arrive at the two points in ‘a’ and ‘b’ hrs, respectively after having met, then.
					<br/>(A's Speed)/(B's Speed)  = √b/√a  
					<br/><br/><b>5:-</b> To convert km/hr to m/s, multiply by 5/18 and to convert m/s to km/hr, multiply by 18/5..

					"
					<b>Relative Speed:-</b>
					<br/><b>Relative speed means the speed of an object A with respect to another object B, which may be stationary, moving (in the same direction or opposite direction)</b>
					<br/><b>Cases:-</b>
					<br/><br/><b>Case 1 : </b> When one object is stationary and other is moving.
					<br>Relative speed of stationary object and moving object = Speed of the moving object
					<br/><br/><b>Case 2 : </b>When two objects are moving in opposite direction
					<br/>Relative speed  = Sum of their speeds
					<br/><br/><b>Case 3 : </b> When two objects are moving in same direction
					<br/>Relative speed  = Difference of their speeds
					<br/><br/><b>Important Points:-</b>
					<br/><b>1:-</b> Time taken by a moving object ‘x’meters long in passing a stationary object ‘y’ meters long from the time they meet, is same as the time taken by the moving object to cover ‘x+y’ meters with its own speed.
					<br/><br/><b>2:-</b> If two objects of length ‘x’ and ‘y’ meters move in the same direction or in opposite direction at ‘a’ and ‘b’ m/s, then the time taken to cross each other  from the time they meet. 
					<br/> = (Sum of their length)/(Relative Speed)  
					<br/> = (x+y)/(a-b)  (In case of same direction)  
					<br/> = (x+y)/(a+b)  (In case of opposite direction)
					<br/><br/><b>3:-</b> If the speed of a boat in still water is x km/hr and the speed of the stream is y km/hr speed while travelling with the stream i.e., speed downstream = (x+y) km/hr speed while travelling against the stream i.e., speed upstream = (x-y) km/hr.
					<br/><br/><b>4:-</b> Speed of the boat in still water =1/2(Speed with Stream + Speed against stream) 
					<br/>    Speed of the river =1/2(Speed with Stream - Speed against stream).
