					<b>The speed of a body is defined as the distance covered by it in unit time.</b>
					<br/><b>Speed = Distance/Time <br/>Time = Distance/Speed <br/> Distance = Speed X Time</b>
					<br/><br/><b>Important Points:-</b>
					<br/><b>1:-</b> If a body travels d1, d2,d3…..dn distances at a speed of s1,s2,s3...sn km/hr,  in time t1, t2,t3……tn, then the average speed  = (Total Distance Travelled)/(Total Time Taken) = (d1+d2+d3+⋯..dn)/(t1+t2+t3+⋯..tn).
					<br/><br/><b>2:-</b> If a certain distance d, from A to B, is covered at ‘a’ km/hr and the same distance is covered again from B to A in ‘b’ km/hr, then the average speed during whole journey= 2ab/((a+b)) km/hr. 
					<br/>Also, if  t1 and t2 is the time taken to travel from A to B and B to A, respectively, the distance ‘d’ from A to B is given by:
					<br/> d= (t1+t2) 2ab/((a+b))  
					<br/> d= (t1-t2) 2ab/((a-b))  
					<br/> d= (a-b) t1t2/((t1-t2))  
					<br/><br/><b>3:-</b> While travelling a certain distance , if a man changes his speed in the ratio m:n, then the ratio of time becomes n:m.
					<br/><br/><b>4:-</b> If two person A and B start at the same time in opposite directions from two points and arrive at the two points in ‘a’ and ‘b’ hrs, respectively after having met, then.
					<br/>(A's Speed)/(B's Speed)  = √b/√a  
					<br/><br/><b>5:-</b> To convert km/hr to m/s, multiply by 5/18 and to convert m/s to km/hr, multiply by 18/5..

					<b>Relative Speed:-</b>
					<br/><b>Relative speed means the speed of an object A with respect to another object B, which may be stationary, moving (in the same direction or opposite direction)</b>
					<br/><b>Cases:-</b>
					<br/><br/><b>Case 1 : </b> When one object is stationary and other is moving.
					<br>Relative speed of stationary object and moving object = Speed of the moving object
					<br/><br/><b>Case 2 : </b>When two objects are moving in opposite direction
					<br/>Relative speed  = Sum of their speeds
					<br/><br/><b>Case 3 : </b> When two objects are moving in same direction
					<br/>Relative speed  = Difference of their speeds
					<br/><br/><b>Important Points:-</b>
					<br/><b>1:-</b> Time taken by a moving object ‘x’meters long in passing a stationary object ‘y’ meters long from the time they meet, is same as the time taken by the moving object to cover ‘x+y’ meters with its own speed.
					<br/><br/><b>2:-</b> If two objects of length ‘x’ and ‘y’ meters move in the same direction or in opposite direction at ‘a’ and ‘b’ m/s, then the time taken to cross each other  from the time they meet. 
					<br/> = (Sum of their length)/(Relative Speed)  
					<br/> = (x+y)/(a-b)  (In case of same direction)  
					<br/> = (x+y)/(a+b)  (In case of opposite direction)
					<br/><br/><b>3:-</b> If the speed of a boat in still water is x km/hr and the speed of the stream is y km/hr speed while travelling with the stream i.e., speed downstream = (x+y) km/hr speed while travelling against the stream i.e., speed upstream = (x-y) km/hr.
					<br/><br/><b>4:-</b> Speed of the boat in still water =1/2(Speed with Stream + Speed against stream) 
					<br/>    Speed of the river =1/2(Speed with Stream - Speed against stream).
