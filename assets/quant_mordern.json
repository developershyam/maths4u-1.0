					<br/><b>Factorial Notation:-</b>
					<br/>Let n be a positive integer. Then, factorial n, denoted n! is defined as:
					<br/>n! = n(n - 1)(n - 2) ... 3.2.1.
					<br/>Examples:
					<br/>We define 0! = 1.
					<br/>4! = (4 x 3 x 2 x 1) = 24.
					
					<br/><b>Combination:-</b> 
					<br/>Combination represent nCr, can be defined as the number of ways in which r things at a time can be SELECTED from amongst n things available for selection.
					<br/>nCr = Number of combinations (selections) of n things taken r things at a time.
					<br/>nCr = n!/ [r!(n-r)!]; where n ≥ r (n is greater than or equal to r)
					
					<br/><b>Some typical situations:-</b>
					<br/>Selection of people of a team, a party, a job an office etc. (e.g. selection of a football team of 11 from 16 member = 16C11
					<br/>Selection of a set of objects (like letters, hats, points, pants, shirts etc.) from amongst another set available.
					
					<br/><b>Permutation:-</b>
					<br/>Permutation (represented by nPr) can be defined as the number of ways in which r things at a time can be SELECTED & ARRANGED at a time from amongst r things.
					<br/>The key word here is ARRANGEMENT. Hence understand here that the order in which the r things are arranged has critical importance in the counting of permutations.
					<br/>nPr = Number of permutations (arrangements) of n things taken r at a time.
					<br/>nPr  = n!/(n-r)!; where n ≥ r
					
					<br/><b>Some typical situations:-</b>
					<br/>Putting distinct objects/people in distinct places, e.g. making people sit, putting letters in envelopes, finishing order in horse race etc.
					<br/>Selection of batting order of a cricket team of 11 from 16 members = 16P11
					<br/>Number of ways in which n different beads can be arranged in a necklace is ½ X (n-1)!
					
					<br/><b>Understanding SELECTION & ARRANGEMENTS</b>
					<br/>SELECTION:
					<br/>Suppose we have 3 men A, B, C out of which 2 men have to be selected for 2 posts. This can be done in the following ways: AB, AC or BC. Physically they can be counted as 3 distinct selections. This value can also be got be using 3C2
					<br/>ARRANGEMENTS: 
					<br/>Suppose we have 3 men A, B, C  out of which 2 men have to be arranged , this can be done in 6 ways: AB, BA, AC, CA, BC, CB. This value can also be get using 3P2
					<br/>Relationship between Permutation & Combination:
					<br/>nPr  = r! X  nCr (Or in other words: The permutation or arrangement of r things out of n is nothing but the selection of r thing out of n followed by the arrangement of r selected things amongst themselves.
					<br/><b>Important things for questions solving:-</b> 
					<br/>1. Number of permutation (arrangements) of n different things taken all at a time = n!
					<br/>2. In case of circular arrangement clockwise and anticlockwise arrangements are distinct arrangements, therefore total arrangement = (n-1)! (If clockwise & anticlockwise observation is same then no. of arrangements = ½ X (n-1)!)
					<br/>3. If out of n arrangements P1, P2 & P3 are alike then number of arrangements
					<br/>= n!/(P1!X P2!X P3!)
					<br/>4. Number of selection from n identical things = 1
					<br/>5. Total number of selection of zero or more things out of n different things = 
					<br/>nC0 +nC1+nC2+…………..+nCn = 2^n
					<br/>If at least 1 has to be selected nC1+nC2+…………..+nCn = 2^n– 1
					<br/>6. If there are three things to do and there are M ways of doing first thing, N ways of doing 2nd thing & P ways of doing 3rd thing, then there will be M X N X P ways of doing all three things together. The works are mutually inclusive.
					<br/>7. “Distributing” n things to r people
					<br/>= n+r-1Cr-1	(When each person may get any number of things)
					<br/>= n-1Cr-1	(When each person may get any number of things excluding “0”)
					<br/>8. If “n Different” things has be distributed among “r different person” then number of ways of doing it =  r^n
					<br/>9. Number of ways of dividing m+n different things in 2 groups containing m and n things respectively = (m+n)!/m!n!
					<br/>10. Number of ways of dividing 2n different things in 2 groups containing n things = 2n!/n!n!2!
					<br/>11. Number of selection of r things out of n different things, when k are
					<br/>Always included  = n-kCr-k
					<br/>Always Excluded = n-kCr
					<br/>12. Number of ways of selecting 0 to n things out of n things where p are of 1 type, q are of other type and r of another type = (p+1)(q+1)(2^r-1)
					<br/>13. Number of terms in series (a0 + a1 + a2 +⋯………..+ an )^m = n+m-1Cn-1
					<br/>14. Number of ways of shake hands by n people = nC2 (Could also be used where 2 teams, and anywhere where 2 groups/people required to perform any action.)
					<br/>15. If a square is made by n horizontal and n vertical lines then total number of square
					<br/>= 1^2+ 2^2+ 3^2+⋯………..n^2

					<br/>	The Characteristic and Mantissa of a Logarithm
					<br/>The logarithm of number consists of two parts: the integral part and the decimal part. The integral part is known as the characteristic and the decimal part is called mantissa
					<br/><b>For example,</b>
					<br/>In log 3257 = 3.5128, the integral part is 3 and mantissa is .5128
					<br/><b>Note:-</b>Mantissa is always to be written as positive. So in case the value of logarithm o f a number is negative, subtract 1 from the integral part and add 1 to the decimal part.
					<br/>Thus, -3.4328 = -3 – 0.4328
					<br/>= (-3 – 1) + (1 – 0.4328) = -4 + .5672 
					<br/>So the mantissa is .5672
					<br/>The characteristic may be positive or negative. When characteristic is negative it is represented by putting a bar on the number. 
					<br/>Thus instead of -4, we write 4 ̅
					<br/>Hence we may write -4 + .5672 = 4 ̅.5672
