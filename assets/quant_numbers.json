					<br/><b>Types of numbers</b>
					<br/><b>Natural numbers:-</b> 
					<br/>The counting numbers {1, 2, 3, ...}, are called natural numbers. They include all the counting numbers i.e. from 1 to infinity.
					<br/><b>Whole numbers:-</b> 
					<br/>They are the natural numbers including zero. Not all whole numbers are natural numbers, but all natural numbers are whole numbers.
					<br/><b>Integers:-</b> 
					<br/>Positive and negative counting numbers, as well as zero. {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}
					<br/><b>Rational numbers:-</b> 
					<br/>Numbers that can be expressed as a fraction of an integer and a non-zero integer.[1]
					<br/><b>Real numbers:-</b> 
					<br/>All numbers that can be expressed as the limit of a sequence of rational numbers. Every real number corresponds to a point on the number line.
					<br/><b>Irrational numbers:-</b> 
					<br/>A real number that is not rational is called irrational.
					<br/><b>Complex numbers:-</b> 
					<br/>Includes real numbers and imaginary numbers, such as the square root of negative one.
					<br/><b>Properties of Integers:-</b> 
					<br/><b>Even and odd numbers:-</b>  
					<br/>A number is even if it is a multiple of two, and is odd otherwise.
					<br/>even * even = even
					<br/>odd * odd = odd
					<br/>even * odd = even
					<br/>even + even = even
					<br/>odd + odd = even
					<br/>even + odd = odd
					<br/><b>Prime number:-</b> 
					<br/>A number with exactly two positive divisors. (See example 1)
					<br/><b>Factors and Multiples:-</b> 
					<br/>An integer ‘n’ is called a factor or a divisor of another integer ‘m’ if ‘n’ divides ‘m’ exactly (i.e. the remainder is ‘zero’ and in such case ‘m’ is called a multiple of ‘n’
					<br/><b>Composite number:-</b>  
					<br/>A number that can be factored into a product of smaller integers. Every integer greater than one is either prime or composite.
					<br/><b>VBODMAS Rule:-</b> 
					<br/>'VBODMAS' (Vinculum - Bracket - Of - Division - Multiplication - Addition - Subtraction) rule should be applied for solving problems involving one or more mathematical operations like multiplication, division, addition, subtraction etc. Such problems are solved in the order of vinculum, bracket, of, division, multiplication, addition and subtraction. Remember 'Of' in VBODMAS means multiplication.
					<br/><b>Base System:-</b> 
					<br/>The Base system in an extension of the system of digits. Every base corresponds to the number of digits in a particular base system. We use the decimal system i.e. base system 10, so it has ten digits or symbols i.e. 0,1,2…9.
					<br/>Similarly, the binary system (Base 2) has 2 digits i.e. 0 and 1. Octal system (Base 8) has eight digits i.e. 0 to 7.
					<br/>But there can be bases beyond the decimal system as well where we are required to show numbers 10,11,12…… and so on the digits. So we use symbols i.e. A, B, C …….. and so on to represent the integral value beyond number 9.
					<br/>Therefore hexadecimal system will have 16 digits i.e. 0,1,2,……….9, A, B, C …..F. Where A is equal to 10, B is equal to 11 and so on, till the last digit 15 which is represented by F.
					<br/><b>Base System Conversion:-</b> 
					<br/>1.	Conversion from Decimal to any other base system ‘X’:
					<br/>Any decimal number can be converted into a number with base ‘X’, by dividing the number by ‘X’, and then successively dividing the quotients by ‘X’. The remainders written in reverse order gives the equivalent number in base ‘X’.
					<br/>2.	Conversion from any other base ‘X’ to the decimal system:
					<br/>Any number with a base of ‘X’ can be converted into equivalent decimal number by adding the product of the digits of the number form the right to the left with increasing powers of X.
					<br/>3.	Conversion from any base ‘X’ to base ‘Y’
					<br/>A number with base ‘X’ can be converted to an equivalent decimal number (shown in point 2 above) and then from decimal from can be converted into a number with base ‘Y’ (shown in point 1 above)

					<b>Find 467 is prime or not?</b>
					<br/>Ans. We find by trial that 467 is not divisible by any of primes 2,5,7,…….19,23. But on dividing by 23 we get a quotient less then 23, and we need not go further. For, if 467 contained a prime factor beyond 23, the quotient obtained on dividing 467 by that prime factor would be less than 23, and must have been revealed as a factor by the former trials. Hence, 467 has no prime factor greater or less than 23; that is, it is prime number. In general, to find whether a number is prime or not, we need to check whether it is divisible by any of the primes up to the square root of that number.

					<br/><b>Factors and Multiples:-</b>
					<br/>If number a divided another number b exactly, we say that a is a factor of b.
					<br/>In this case, b is called a multiple of a.
					<br/>Prime numbers that divide the integer exactly are prime factors.
					<br/>For ex. N = 540 = 4 X 27 X 5 = 2^2 X 3^3 X5 
					<br/>So1, 2, 3 and 5 are prime factors. 
					<br/>The number of ways in which a number can be expressed as the product of two factors which are relatively prime to each other = 2^m-1
					<br/><b>Highest Common Factor (H.C.F.) or Greatest Common Measure (G.C.M.) or Greatest Common Divisor (G.C.D.):-</b>
					<br/>The H.C.F. of two or more than two numbers is the greatest number that divides each of them exactly.
					<br/>There are two methods of finding the H.C.F. of a given set of numbers:
					<br/>Factorization Method: Express the each one of the given numbers as the product of prime factors. The product of least powers of common prime factors gives H.C.F.
					<br/>Division Method: Suppose we have to find the H.C.F. of two given numbers, divide the larger by the smaller one. Now, divide the divisor by the remainder. Repeat the process of dividing the preceding number by the remainder last obtained till zero is obtained as remainder. The last divisor is required H.C.F.
					<br/>Finding the H.C.F. of more than two numbers: Suppose we have to find the H.C.F. of three numbers, then, H.C.F. of [(H.C.F. of any two) and (the third number)] gives the H.C.F. of three given number.
					<br/>Similarly, the H.C.F. of more than three numbers may be obtained.
					<br/><b>Least Common Multiple (L.C.M.):-</b>
					<br/>The least number which is exactly divisible by each one of the given numbers is called their L.C.M.
					<br/>There are two methods of finding the L.C.M. of a given set of numbers:
					<br/>Factorization Method: Resolve each one of the given numbers into a product of prime factors. Then, L.C.M. is the product of highest powers of all the factors.
					<br/>Division Method (short-cut): Arrange the given numbers in a rwo in any order. Divide by a number which divided exactly at least two of the given numbers and carry forward the numbers which are not divisible. Repeat the above process till no two of the numbers are divisible by the same number except 1. The product of the divisors and the undivided numbers is the required L.C.M. of the given numbers.
					<br/><b>Product of two numbers = Product of their H.C.F. and L.C.M. (See example 2)
					<br/><b>Co-primes: Two numbers are said to be co-primes if their H.C.F. is 1.
					<br/><b>H.C.F. and L.C.M. of Fractions:
				    <br/>1. H.C.F. =	H.C.F. of Numerators/L.C.M. of Denominators
				    <br/>2. L.C.M. =	L.C.M. of Numerators/H.C.F. of Denominators
					<br/><b>H.C.F. and L.C.M. of Decimal Fractions:
					<br/>In a given numbers, make the same number of decimal places by annexing zeros in some numbers, if necessary. Considering these numbers without decimal point, find H.C.F. or L.C.M. as the case may be. Now, in the result, mark off as many decimal places as are there in each of the given numbers.
					<br/><b>Comparison of Fractions:
					<br/>Find the L.C.M. of the denominators of the given fractions. Convert each of the fractions into an equivalent fraction with L.C.M as the denominator, by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same number.

					<br/><b>Reminders:-</b>
					<br/>A natural number ‘m’ when divided by a natural number  ‘n’ will yield the remainder that is a whole number and less than n i.e. 0,1,2,…….n-1
					<br/><b>Methods to find remainder:-</b>
					<br/><b>Cyclicity of remainders:</b>
					<br/>Successive powers of a number when divided by the same number leave remainders that follow a cyclic pattern. Using this pattern, the remainder of the division of any power of that number (by the same number) can be found out.
					<br/>Ex.  To find reminder of 2^54 when divided by 7
					<br/>Answer. 2^1,2^2,2^3,2^4,2^5,2^(6 ) and 2^7 when divided by 7 leave remainders of 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1 and 2 respectively.
					<br/>So the pattern repeats after 3 steps.
					<br/>Thus remainder 2^54 when divided by 7 will be same as remainder of 2^3 when divided by 7. 
					<br/>Hence remainder of 2^54 is 1.
					<br/><b>Remainder Theorem:</b>
					<br/>If a natural number ‘n’ divided by a natural number ‘m’ and can be brought in the form
					<br/>(x.(a<sup>p</sup>)<sup>q</sup>)/(a<sup>p</sup>- 1), such that
					<br/>	n = x.(a<sup>p</sup>)<sup>q</sup>
					<br/>	m = a<sup>p</sup>- 1
					<br/>	x, a, p & q are all natural numbers
					<br/>	x < m
					<br/>Then the remainder of the division of ‘n’ by ‘m’ is ‘x’
					<br/>Ex. To find remainder of 2^5 divided by 7
					<br/>2<sup>5</sup>/7= (2<sup>2</sup>.(2<sup>3</sup> )<sup>1</sup>)/(2<sup>3</sup>- 1) or remainder  = 2<sup>2</sup> = 4					
					<br/><b>Factorials:-</b>
					<br/>The product of the first ‘n’ natural numbers in n! (Pronounced as n factorial)
					<br/>n! = 1X2X3X………(n-1)X(n)
					<br/>For ex. 3! = 3X2X1 = 6
					<br/>The factorial of every number greater than 1 will have one or more prime numbers.
					<br/>A factorial of a number (except number 1) is either a prime number or a combination of 1 or more prime numbers.
					<br/><b>Highest power of a number in factorial</b>
					<br/>To find powers of a prime number ‘p’ contained in n!, where n is natural number.
					<br/>Highest power of prime number ‘p’ in n! = [n/p] + [n/p<sup>2</sup>] + [n/p<sup>3</sup>] + [n/p<sup>4</sup>] + ... 
					<br/>Where the value of term in the [ ] is the greatest integral value less than or equal to term..
					<br/>Ex.  Highest power of 2 in 20!
					<br/>= [20/2] + [20/2<sup>2</sup>] + [20/2<sup>3</sup>] + [20/2<sup>4</sup>]
					<br/>= 10 + 5 + 2 +1 = 18
					<br/>Note: In case of finding highest power of composite number C, find largest prime factor C. Use above method for finding highest power of prime number. Highest power of that prime number will be highest power of composite number. (See example 2)
					<br/><b>Properties of number based result:-</b>
					<br/>To find the smallest number (say x), which when divided by 2 or more divisors, leaves the same reminder in each case.
					<br/>X = Remainder + LCM of divisor X k (where k is a positive integer)
					<br/>Ex. To find smallest 3 digit number which when divided by 3, 4, 5 leaves a remainder of 2
					<br/>So x = 2 + (LCM of 3,4,5)X2 (to get smallest 3 digit k = 2)
					<br/>Or x = 2 + 60X2 = 122
					<br/>To find the smallest number (say x), which when divided by 2 or more divisors, leave a different remainder in each case, such that there is a common difference between the divisor and corresponding remainder.
					<br/>In general, x = LCM of divisor X k (Where k is a positive integer) – Common difference
					<br/>IF we consider 3 consecutive positive integers, say (n-1), n, (n+1) then the product of them i.e. n. ((n^2-1) is always divisible by 6.
					<br/>If ‘n’ is an odd prime number greater than 3, than (n<sup>2</sup>-1) will always be divisible by 24.
					<br/>For any ‘n’ consecutive positive integers, the product is divisible by n and n!.
					<br/>For every positive integer n, n<sup>3</sup>-n is divisible by 3, n<sup>5</sup>-n is divisible by 5, n<sup>11</sup>-n is divisible by 11. In general, if ‘p’ is a prime number then for any natural number ‘n’  n<sup>p</sup>-n is divisible by ‘p’.
					<br/>If a number n is divisible by each of 2 relatively prime numbers, then it is also divisible by the product of 2 numbers.
					<br/>If a product ab is divisible by c, where b and c are relatively prime then a is divisible by c.
