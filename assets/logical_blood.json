					<br/>The easiest and non-confusing way to solve these types of problems would be to draw a family tree diagram and increase the levels in hierarchy. Grandfather and grandmother will come in the first stage, mother, father, uncle and aunt will come in the second stage; sister, brother and cousin will come at the third stage; son, daughter, niece and nephew will come in the fourth stage and finally, granddaughters and grandsons will come.  
					<br/>To remember easily the relations may be divided into two sides as given below:
					<br/><b>1. Relations of Paternal side:-</b>
					<br/>1.	Father's father → Grandfather
					<br/>2.	Father's mother → Grandmother
					<br/>3.	Father's brother → Uncle
					<br/>4.	Father's sister → Aunt
					<br/>5.	Children of uncle → Cousin
					<br/>6.	Wife of uncle → Aunt
					<br/>7.	Children of aunt → Cousin
					<br/>8.	Husband of aunt → Uncle
					<br/><b>2. Relations of Maternal side:-</b>
					<br/>1.	Mother's father → Maternal grandfather
					<br/>2.	Mother's mother → Maternal grandmother
					<br/>3.	Mother's brother Maternal uncle
					<br/>4.	Mother's sister → Aunt
					<br/>5.	Children of maternal uncle → Cousin
					<br/>6.	Wife of maternal uncle → Maternal aunt
